            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>This Booke challengeth an eminent Dedication of it ſelfe both <hi>ex congruo &amp; condigno</hi> in diverſe regards. For firſt, the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Theame, which beares the burthen of the whole Diſcourſe, and Tractate is the ten Commandements of Almighty God, which are the ten Predicaments of all thoſe vertues and vices, which render men either acceptable or odious to their Maker; the Scripture of Scripture, as being prerogatived above the whole Bible, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, that in iſſuing them forth to the ſonnes of men, God was
<pb facs="tcp:48000:3"/>pleaſed to become his owne <hi>Amanuenſis;</hi> The whole Scripture is<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> inſpired by God, but onely<note n="*" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.21.</note> holy men of God ſpake and wrote them as they were inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt, but here God both indited and ſpake and wrote, not onely the mind and mouth, but the<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 8.19.</note> 
                     <hi>Finger of God</hi> was here.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Author of this Booke is enough praiſed in naming of him, it was <hi>Dr. Andrewes,</hi> the late Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> a man both at home and abroad of great fame, for his Clerk, ſhip, and of a good fame for his regular and ſtrict life: of whom the leſſe is ſaid, the more is ſaid, for that to fetch luſtre to his name from a meane ſtile or tongue, is to goe Northward for heat.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the worke it ſelfe is ſuch, as in thoſe dayes when it was Preached, he was ſcarce reputed a pretender to learning and piety then in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> who made not himſelfe a diſciple of <hi>Mr. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drewes</hi> by diligent reſorting to his Lectures: nor he a pretender to the ſtudy of Divinity, who did not tranſcribe his notes, and ever ſince they have in many hundreds of Copies paſſed from hand to hand, and have beene eſteemed a very Library to young Divines, and an Oracle to conſult at, to Laureat and grave Divines: in all which ſeverall regards, they are more fit to ſweeten, and even to ſanctifie the Preſſe, from the pollutions and prophanations of it, which of late it hath beene defiled withall, by thoſe many lying and ſcandalous pamphlets, which have beene Printed to the diſhonour of God, the ſhame of ours, and juſt diſtaſte of other Nations, to the prejudice of truth and charity, and to the particular wrong of that excellent Art of <hi>Printing,</hi> which being rightly uſed is of ſuch availe to all Chriſtian both Churches and Commonwealths.</p>
                  <p>And that the publiſher hereof makes ſuch a bold and ambitious ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe unto your Honours, as to Nuncupate and preſent it to ſo high and eminent perſons, this is to be ſaid, that as the worke in it ſelfe is ſo worthy, as it may juſtly be thought to merit the wing and patronage of the greateſt Chriſtian Prince in the world, ſo can it now no where be laid ſo properly as at the feete of the <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, becauſe hereby the Law of God, which is both the best rule of making humane Lawes, and the beſt enforcement to yeeld obedience unto them being made, is in you virtually, and by way of repreſentation, expounded to the whole Nation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:48000:3"/>
                  <p>Nextly, not onely Kings, but, according to their Latitude, all Magiſtrates and Civill powers ordayned of God (whereof yours is the chiefe) are <hi>Cuſtodes utriuſque tabulae.</hi> And alſo, becauſe here are two strong and ſinewy Tractates, the one about Idolatry in handling the ſecond <hi>Commandement:</hi> and the other about obſervation of the Sabbath, under the fourth; which will both no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably redargue the late heterodox inſinuations of both doctrine and practice in ſome, anent thoſe things, and concurre with you in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugning the Orthodox tenets of both thoſe points.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, becauſe Preachers are publique Oratours, and like winds upon ſeas, have great influence upon the people, therefore here they have preſidented before them, that which in due time will fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Conſiderations to call them unto, to wit, the right Art of Sermoning and ſalvificall Preaching, which conſiſts not in State invectives, or popular declamations, to ſway multitudes and tumults, either one way or other, (wherein they Preach themſelves, and not Chriſt) but in revealing <hi>the whole Counſell of God,</hi> and ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their auditors how to decline the infortunate Jſlands of ſin and hell, and to thruſt into the <hi>faire havens</hi> of grace and glory. God Almighty of his great mercy ſo bleſſe your Counſels, as that truth may empire over errour in the Church: Peace triumph over divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the Common-wealth: Plenty over famine in the Countrey: Riches over poverty in the City: Learning over barbariſme in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities, &amp;c.

That which is ordained to receive God, all the world is too little to fill it; and without God there is no univerſall good: and therefore there is ſome want, and therefore deſire, and therefore labour to come to it, and therefore unquietneſſe, and therefore no felicity. <hi>Facilius appareat in ſpeciali examplo,</hi> this more eaſily may appeare in particular example; as of riches. <gap reason="foreign">

But if a man ſhould heape never ſo much wood on the fire, though at the firſt it might ſeeme to keepe it downe, and put it out; yet by little and little the fire will wax bigger and bigger, &amp;c. and ſo in riches, the more matter is miniſtred, the leſſe it is quenched; and ſo this deſire waxeth infinite. <hi>Quid cius ſitim reſtinguet, cujus ſitis è potu creſcit?</hi> what can quench his thirſt, whoſe thirſt increaſeth by drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? There is no worldly thing to ſatisfie the appetite of man: riches were not made to fill a mans minde, no more then a bagge to be filled with learning; or one to ſtand all day gaping in the wind, thinking to be filled therewith. 3. Though it would receive them, yet is it not put to the ſoule of man: contrary to that principle, <hi>Oportet apponi deſideratum deſideranti;</hi> that the thing deſired muſt be ſet before him that deſireth it. 4. Granting all this to be; yet when one hath all that he deſired to have, he may have a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite; and ſo after he hath filled one bagge, he may deſire to fill another; after one barne, another. Here they are compared, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.15. to Horſeleeches, give, give: and to the greedy Maſtiffe, that ſwalloweth whole morſels, as faſt as they are caſt to him. <hi>Id apparet in Alexandro planiſſimè,</hi> this appeareth in <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that ſhed many teares after he had conquered all the World, for that there were no more worlds. <hi>Theocritus,</hi> and every one will wiſh, <hi>Mille meis errent in montibus agni; &amp; ſic denuo aſcendet gradatim eorum appetitus,</hi> that they had a thouſand ſheepe feeding on the Mountaines, and ſo their deſire will increaſe by degrees; untill they may ſay, <hi>pauperis eſt numerare pecus,</hi> it's for a poore man to tell his cattell. As <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18. deſcended, in his interceſſion for <hi>Sodome</hi> from fifty to ten, ſo will they deſcend. Therefore we may conclude, that all theſe waies are unnaturall; and this deſire unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall. If an appetite be naturall, it hath his end: elſe if it hath not his end, it is unnaturall. Therefore they are not out of the way; <hi>Via enim eunti terminus eſt;</hi> for the way is the bound to him that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; therefore it is not poſſible to have an end, but of God: but they, when they are filled, ceaſe not; <hi>Quia non ex vacuitate, ſed ex abundantia eorum appetitus oritur: quod naturale eſt, expletum ceſſat, quia ex vacuitate.

How came the beaſts to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped as Gods? The waies are many; but they may be reduced to theſe three: two of the deifying of men, one of beaſts. After the flood, a generall revolting from religion: and that that did them good, they worſhipped as God. Now by reaſon of the ſlymes and mud, there grew many Serpents and many monſters; at the laſt the beaſts greatly multiplyed. And thirdly, there increaſed a ſort of beaſtly men, given to Epicuriſine. Againſt theſe three, thoſe that oppoſed themſelves, both in regard of the good received by them, and to ſtirre up others to doe the like; they worſhipped them with divine honours. Another way was this. <hi>Porphyrie</hi> ſaith that <hi>Ninus</hi> in honour of <hi>Belus</hi> his father, having obtained the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, erected an Image for his love of the dead. This Image, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would have it no leſſe eſteemed of others then of himſelfe, made it a ſanctuary: ſo that if any malefactor, or any that was in debt, had fled to it, he was ſafe, and freed from his debt. So by this, divers having received benefit; partly to be thankefull for their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit received, partly to doe <hi>Ninus</hi> a pleaſure, then living and bearing rule, they ſolemnized it with hymnes, and with feaſts, inſtituted certaine daies for the ſolemniſing of it; hanged it about with garlands: <hi>baecque virtutis ergô facta ſunt, &amp; celebrandae illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um hominum mortuorum, &amp; incitandae poſterorum;</hi> theſe things were done for vertues ſake, to extoll famous men dead, and to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of the poſterity. After, the cauſe of this celebration being forgot, they began to make prayers unto it; firſt in verſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting it a light thing to ſing Hymnes unto it in verſe, after in proſe. And this was that Bel in the Scriptures, which the broader dialect of the Hebrewes call <hi>Baal.</hi>

But becauſe the fourth principall queſtion is ſo neerely joyned with the proofes of Chriſts Religion, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in one or two points, they cannot be ſevered: Therefore it is not amiſſe, to handle both under one. 1. The effect of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apoſtle here is, that we have a moſt ſure word from the Prophets, and of all thoſe, from whoſe hands we have received the Scriptures. This is moſt ſure. And albeit there is but a ſmall portion come immediately from God; yet being delivered by the miniſtery of man, the miniſtery of man prevailed no farther, then that it agreed with the word immediately comming from God. 1. Seeing that man is to come to God ſome way, and religion is this way; we neceſſarily gather, that this way is as ancient as man himſelfe: elſe ſhould there be a time wherein man was out of this way, and ſo conſequently fruſtrated of his end. 2. <hi>Tertullian. de praeſcript. adverſus haeret: Quod primum, verum,</hi> what is firſt is true. It holdeth in religion, and in any other thing. The Philoſ. <hi>Entia maximè vera,</hi> being chiefely true.

Therefore falſhood <hi>non poteſt conſiſtere in ſuo, ſed in alieno,</hi> cannot conſiſt in it ſelfe, but in another. Therefore falſhood is after truth. (Aſſum.) But the religion of the Chriſtians is more ancient; for the Jewiſh and Chriſtian religion are both one. The Law is nothing elſe but the old Goſpell, the Goſpell nothing elſe but the new Law. The Law <hi>Evangelium abſconditum,</hi> a hidden Goſpell. The Goſpell <hi>Lex revelata,</hi> a revealed Law. So that they agree with us till the comming of Chriſt, and there they leave us.</p>
                        <p>As for the Heathen religion, a great part of their ſtories is fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; and part true. For that part which is fabulous, it began with their Gods: for further then their Gods they cannot doe. Now their Gods (as <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Homer</hi> that write upon them) they cannot be but the age before the Trojane warre: foraſmuch as <hi>Hercules, Aeneas,</hi> and the reſt of their children lived at that warre, which warre was 3030. yeeres after the Chronology of the Bible. And betweene <hi>Orpheus</hi> his writing, which was their ancienteſt Poet, and <hi>Moſes,</hi> are at leaſt 800. yeeres. As <hi>Strabo, Plutarch, Diodor. Siculus,</hi> doe teſtifie.

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48000:30"/>ſure, that the ancienteſt records of their truth, come from the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wiſe men, of whom <hi>Solon</hi> is the chiefe and ancienteſt:<note place="margin">The reſtoring of the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> in <hi>Eſdras</hi> time.</note> he was in <hi>Croeſus</hi> time; <hi>Croeſus</hi> with <hi>Cyrus.

So in each Covenant, there were two parties: in the firſt, God and <hi>Adam:</hi> The Covenant on Gods ſide, eternall felicity, both in this life, and in the life to come: on <hi>Adams,</hi> perfect obedience. Therefore it is called the Covenant of obedience.

                           </list> On Gods ſide, felicity; or the conveyance of his eternall right to Chriſts. On Chriſts, ſatisfaction to God: to us, to reſtore all to us that we have loſt. On our ſide, faith unfai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. As man fell, and by his fall, loſt all that he had; ſo if he would recover that he loſt, he was to make ſatisfaction: and beſide, if he could fulfill the Law, he had promiſe of eternall felicity. Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertooke this perfect ſatisfaction for man: ſuffered all, that man ſhould have ſuffered; and ſo tooke away the penalty: ſatiſfied the forfeiture; and ſo reſtored all that man had loſt: and ſo came to two rights; one of inheritance, another of purchaſement. The right of inheritance, which he had by nature, in that he was the Sonne of God, he reteineth himſelfe: the other of purchacement, he giveth to all them that lay hold of him, <hi>fide non ficta,</hi> with faith unfained; and that not of our owne ſtrength, but in Chriſt: and therefore its called the covenant of faith, and that with no loſſe; for if a thing be taken away, and a recompence be made by a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thing, there is no taking away. The reaſon of this ſecond cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is, that if the firſt covenant had ſtood, and <hi>Adam</hi> had remained in his owne ſtrength, he muſt needs have had ſome part of the honour for uſing it well; and not abuſing it when he might: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that God might have the whole glory, he ſuffered the firſt to be broken; for God in creating required onely honour. Therefore man fell. For his fall he was to make ſatisfaction; this was not to be performed but in Gods ſtrength; the grace of God preventing us, and making us of unwilling, willing; and of unable, able: in that meaſure that God will require at their hands: we have all our ſtrength from God. So that the firſt covenant. <hi>i. Moſes</hi> his Law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weake and unperfect, ſtanding on a promiſe in figure, and curſe without figure: in truth the figure was performed in Chriſt; the curſe taken away by his death: then, when <hi>perfecta,</hi> things perfect came, <hi>imperfect a abiêre,</hi> things imperfect were done away; one Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God maketh not any bond but onely in part: that is, the curſe taken away by grace: the ceremony by the truth of Chriſts: and that which is fulfilled ſhall be taken in the Court of Grace, not pleaded in the Court of <hi>Moyſes:</hi> that is, in the ſincerity of faith, not in perfection of the Law.</p>

All men guilty of prevarication, and doing againſt their owne knowledge. But <hi>Pauls</hi> owne argument is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent: becauſe the ſtipend of ſinne hath taken hold on all: and the ſtipend of ſinne is death; God being juſt: therefore ſinne alſo muſt needs take hold on all. <hi>David</hi> confeſſed this, <hi>Delict a quis intelligit, Who can underſtand his faults? Salomon</hi> confeſſed he could lay no clame to it. What then? If all offend, it ſhould ſeeme God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an impoſſible thing to be kept; It is ſure that God is juſt. Therefore we muſt thinke, that there is no injuſtice in the dealings of God; though the matter be never ſo untoward, yet the rule muſt be ſtreight, not as a Lesbian leaden rule. 2. It cannot be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; for God being perfectly juſt, his rule alſo muſt be perfectly juſt. Why then were we not made to it; <hi>Adam</hi> received ſtrength to fulfill it in that perfection that was required: but he was like the evill ſervant, who receiving money of his maſter to accompliſh his buſineſſe; ſpendeth it, and ſo maketh his excuſe, that he hath no money to lay out; or being ſent about his maſters buſineſſe, in the way is drunken, and ſo is not able to diſcharge that buſineſſe, that is juſtly required at his hands.

Therefore, firſt he maketh a Catalogue of the benefits and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God. So that the ordinary meanes to ſtirre up a will in us, to embrace the Law of God, is, that we enter into a mediation with our ſelves concerning the benefits that our countrey, parents, friends, kinsfolkes, have received; that either reſpect us, or them that touch us. The Lord by that right intereſt he hath in us by vertue of creation, that we are as pots in his hands, to be either made or bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as he will: and that we are as ſons, and as born ſubjects, he may command us to doe this, and need not to reward the doers of it: as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> his ſubjects had nothing for doing his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; but if they did it not, the Oven ſhould be heated ſeven times hotter: yea we are <hi>Deivernae,</hi> Gods bond-men; and as the Poet ſaith,<note place="margin">A fourefold conſideration of the mercies of God.</note>

No matter that a man may ſooner fall into, then the conſideration of the Lords benefits.

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48000:46"/>us wind or haileſtones, yet in that reſpect alſo, we ought to praiſe the Lord. How much more then, for giving us a living ſoule.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. For the uſe of naturall functions, for the uſe of all our members; if we were bereft of the uſe of an arme, or an eye, or any one member, how exceedingly beholden would we thinke our ſelves to be, to thoſe that could reſtore the uſe of this member, by reaſon of the grievouſneſſe of the want of the uſe thereof. Much more ought we to be thankefull to him, that hath given us the uſe of all.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 3. But when we conſider that he hath given us a reaſonable ſoule, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a third degree of thankfulneſſe; and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Quiſque optat cum ſanâ mente perpetuò lamentari, quàm cum inſanâ ridere,</hi> each man had rather be in perpetuall ſorrow, with a ſound mind, then in joy with an outragious. But the fourth ſwalloweth up all the reſt: namely, if we conſider the goodneſſe and glory of all things,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>(though the earth be the Lords, and all that therein is) yet that he hath choſen us above all to be of his Church, and to pertaine to him. All the other be extreme miſeries without this. And this we ſhall learne thus to valew: If we conſider the Saints of God, that were wiſer then the ſonnes of men, how they have choſen him with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite calamities, and have refuſed places of great preferment, rather than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſinne for a ſeaſon: as <hi>Moſes,</hi> to ſuffer afflictions with the people of God, then to be called <hi>Pharaohs</hi> daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſonne.</p>

The Prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> 64.4. valueth them by the eye, eare, heart; and he denieth that eye hath ſeene, or eare hath heard, or that it hath entred into the heart of man, to underſtand thoſe joyes that are for them, which
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48000:47"/>ſeeke him. For ſince the beginning of the World, they have not heard nor underſtood with the eares, neither hath the eye ſeene another God, beſide thee, which doth ſo to him that waiteth for him.

Therefore the joyes of the World to come muſt paſſe infinite, being compaſſed about with the fleſh, when as yet it was never ſeene, heard, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of any.

Therefore this is it that we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of it, that it is more then we can conceive.

For the neereneſſe, what greater can be then betweene creature and Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; and then by the ſecond bond of adoption, we ſhall be his ſons. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.18. <hi>What am I, and what is my life, that I ſhould be ſonne in law to the King! David</hi> maketh it a wonderfull great matter to be ſonne in law to the King; much more to God. 3. For Benefits, The Aſſe knoweth the Maſters Cribbe, and the Oxe the Stall: he hath not onely beſtowed on thoſe that were before rehearſed; but his love was ſuch to mankind, that he was faine to have his onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſonne, to come downe and die for us: And if this move us not, then let <hi>Jeremies</hi> ſaying take place, <hi>Obſtupeſcat coelum, &amp; terra,</hi> let Heaven and Earth be aſtoniſhed.

                           <p>NOw theſe ten precepts muſt be ſorted into theſe two Tables of God; and in the ſorting of them there may ariſe ſome doubt: The firſt is betweene the Jewes and the Chriſtians: the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Chriſtians themſelves.<note place="margin">1.

Their warrant, as they thinke, is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82.6. <hi>I have ſaid, ye are Gods,</hi> therefore the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to be referred to the firſt Table. <hi>Anſwer.</hi>

                           <p>Secondly, betweene the Chriſtians themſelves. The Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they make the two firſt, one: and the laſt Commandement they ſtretch and make two of it. Wherein they follow not the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt number of Fathers, as they ſay they doe in their interpretations: but divide this Commandement, into <hi>non concupiſces vitam, non con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſces famam.</hi> Thou ſhalt not covet the life, thou ſhalt not covet the name.</p>

Commandement; and <hi>non concupiſes famam proximi tui,</hi> thou ſhalt not covet the name of thy neighbour; which is the deſire of the ninth, might as well make two Commandements, as theſe two; and better too. But common ſenſe telleth us, that to make lawes of particulars, is the greateſt folly that may be. Much leſſe Gods law, which is exceedingly generall. And we ſee that of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, ſet downe here in generall, there are two branches of it: and when they interpret of it in their comments, they ſay they finde ſome little difference betweene them: and indeed they finde ſuch inconvenience, that commonly they include them both into one.</item>

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48000:57"/>for actions; the actions of man being infinite, both for variety and number, becauſe the circumſtances, and the degrees of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are infinite; the rules alſo ſhould be infinite, and ſo exceed the memory of man; which cannot be: therefore God taking another courſe, hath ſet downe generall rules; and ſo doth man after his example.

That which every Prince challengeth to himſelfe, a prerogative royall to diſpenſe with his owne poſitive law.

This if it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall, is called a priviledge. This being granted to earthly Princes, with a greater right it may be granted to God. For their diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions commonly proceed from their will, which may be corrupt: but Gods will is the rule of all juſtice: there can be no danger in his diſpenſations. This is their rule. <hi>Quod licitum eſt, mutatur exſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniente cauſa,</hi> what is lawfull, is changed by the acceſſion of a new cauſe. So in ſome caſes God hath reſtrained his law, but very ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome diſpenſed; ſuch a thing is in the Law of God, though not ſo common. The warrant of this is either firſt by his word, the image of the brazen ſerpent, againſt the ſecond Commandement. Or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by ratifying by ſignes, bleſſing them by extraordinary gifts, above the courſ of mankind For theſe diſpenſations or exemptions from the common law, becauſe they be priviledges, they are to be reſtrained to the perſons, to whom they were granted; as in the doings of the Prophets, theſe warrants now ceaſe. <hi>Quae exorbitant à jure communi, non ſunt trahenda in conſequentiam, vel argumento argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti, vel exemplo.</hi> This is a maxim. Theſe things which ſwerve from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48000:62"/>common right, are not to be drawne into conſequence, either for proofe of an argument, or for example. Though we be willing to make many reſtraints, yet there are but few: and if we make more, great injury is done to God. Its a commendation of a law, to have feweſt priviledges, (for where there are feweſt diſpenſations, there is moſt equity,) as he ſaid of Rome, that all the good Emperours might be graven on the one ſide of a penny: and therefore great injury done to God in it, granting they were. Therefore in Gods, they ſhould be, &amp; are feweſt. The ſlaughter of <hi>Phineas,</hi> the marriage of <hi>Oſeah,</hi> the robbery of the Egyptians, are not reſtraints: for this is certaine, that though they were, yet they are not for us: they are not for our times, neither have we the ſigne of the voice of God for them. And it may be proved ſubſtantially, that many things in the old Teſtament, which are thought to be reſtraints, were not, but kept to the uttermoſt. This is to ſtop the mouth of vaine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that cannot uphold themſelves but with the diſtinction of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and extraordinary: and indeed, all the ſtirre now adaies is about the limiting of ordinary and extraordinary.

In the firſt Table, three Commandements are perpetuall, one temporall; <hi>cedat temporale aeterno,</hi> let the temporall give place to the eternall. Therefore the fourth in the firſt: if it come in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with any of the other, it may be violated: the reſt of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath may be broken, that Gods Name may be ſanctified: In the ſecond Table, <hi>Non occides, Thou ſhalt not kill;</hi> Therefore that being the Table of juſtice; and we know that the nature of juſtice is, <hi>
                                 <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t cuivis detur debitum, nulli fiat indebitum,</hi> that due be given to every one; what is not due, be done to none. An innocent man may not be ſlaine, but he that deſerveth it, <hi>Si non lingua demittat voluntatem peccandi, amittat poteſtatem,</hi> If the tongue let not go the will to ſin, let it loſe the power. Either he is to fulfill the Law <hi>faciendo quod debet,</hi> or <hi>patiendo quod debet,</hi> by doing what he ought, <hi>or</hi> by ſuffering what he ought. Or the Magiſtrate in Gods right is to puniſh him. If any of the other come in compariſon with the fift Commandement, its to give place; becauſe that is <hi>de communi bono,</hi> of the common good: the other <hi>de privato,</hi> of the private: and <hi>commune privato praeferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> common is to be preferred before private; generall before particular.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48000:63"/>Order in the ſecond Table; that which is common before that which is private: in the ſtate of a damage, damage of life before damage of chaſtity; in chaſtity, before in goods; in goods, before fame. For goods a real thing, but fame nothing elſe but a depravati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the opinion of other men, grounded on a naturall reaſon. <hi>Cujus finis ſuperior, illud praeferatur.</hi> Whoſe end is ſuperiour, let that be preferred.</p>
                           <p>We are more reſtrained in actions, then in word; and in word, more then in thought. life is more precious then chaſtity, chaſtity then ſubſtance, ſubſtance then fame; there can be no better order then that which God hath ſet downe, <hi>Ordinavit Deus charitatem,</hi> God hath appointed love.</p>
                           <p>There remaineth a third caſe, and that is this: A Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is doubtfull, either by obſcurity in the chiefe ſentence; or by a word of ambiguity, that may beare two ſenſes or more: or by controverſie, when there is an hearing on both ſides, ſo that men cannot agree; for it pleaſed certaine wits to bring in controverſies that need not. We muſt have a direction for this: <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> writing on <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. <hi>In nullo debet opinio vacillare,</hi> Opinion ought to waver in nothing. He ſaith, if that be true, how ſhall many doe, that though in words they be very reſolute, yet inwardly may <hi>vacillare,</hi> waver; and no man ſeeth, but God ſeeth, and conſequently no man reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them? There is no other way, ſaith he, then <hi>tene rectum, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte incertum,</hi> hold the right; let goe the doubtfull: the counſell is good, whatſoever a man doth, let him doe it with full confidence.

                           <p>Three ſpeciall points to be obſerved, through the whole courſe of the Commandements.
<list>
                                 <item>1. The three firſt, and the five laſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, they runne in the ſecond perſon ſingular, Thou ſhalt not doe this or that, &amp;c. Gods ſtile is not like the ſtile of the lawes of the heathen; that runnes in the third perſon plurall, <hi>Deos adeunto caſtè,</hi> &amp;c. let them approach the Gods chaſtly.</item>
                                 <item>2. That for the moſt part they runne in the negative (onely two excepted) the three firſt, and the five laſt.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. They runne in the future tenſe, the fourth and the fifth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, eight of them. For the firſt, we ſee in <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. God begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth and ſpeaketh to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as to one man: <hi>Audi Iſrael, Non h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>bebis Deos alienos coram me,</hi> Heare Iſrael, thou ſhalt not have ſtrange Gods before me. He ſpeaketh to all, and to all alike: as to the baſeſt of the army, ſo to <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron.</hi> Its an argument of equality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the bond of obſerving the law of God: none is more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it than another: therefore by vertue of that <hi>Non moechaberis,</hi> Thou ſhalt not commit adultery, <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David, Tu es homo.</hi> Thou art the man. And <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> though he were a King, <hi>Non licet tibi, &amp;c.</hi> It is not lawfull for thee. So on the other ſide it leaveth us not in a generality, that we may ſlip our necks: but its in the ſecond perſon; which whoſoever heareth or readeth, its as forcible, as if there were ſo man y <hi>Tu's,</hi> as there are perſons that heare it. So for application its beſt, becauſe every man hearing it ſpoken in the ſecond perſon, applieth it ſtreight to himſelfe, and is as forcible, as if he applied his ſpeech to every particular thing that every man had done.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The negative: and therein we have a confirmation of the contrary: of the negative its ſaid in Logicke, <hi>ad plura ſe extendit negatio, quàm affirmatio,</hi> The negative extends farther then the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative. It was Gods purpoſe to have his Commandements bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten out ſo farre, as the rules of extention uſed by Chriſt, would ſuffer: and though <hi>ad negationem non ſequitur affirmatio oppoſiti,</hi> unto a negative, the affirming of the contrary doth not follow; yet the rule in Logicke holdeth onely in bare affirmations and negations; not in commanding and forbidding: for in lawes, <hi>qui prohibet impedimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, praecipit adjumentum.</hi> His intent is to have a thing done, when he will have the impediments taken away. <hi>Qui negat prohibens, jubet promovens.</hi> He commandeth the helpe, who taketh away the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Its an admonition to us, to ſhew us how full of impediments
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48000:64"/>we are by nature, that we muſt heare of many lets, before we can come to heare what is commanded. A no, before a yea. How full of weeds our nature is; that it is not capable of a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but of a countermand. We are not capable of God before we are weeded of that which is evill. The future tenſe, <hi>i.</hi> that as its <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, a ſecret ſigne of our tranſgreſſions paſt: ſo that for the times to come, its uncertaine what we will be. But for the times paſt, we know what we have beene; grievous offenders. A warning concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the inclineableneſſe of our nature in time to come, that even then we are as ready to doe wickedly, as before we were. For as there is one that will ſay, <hi>Non facies,</hi> Thou ſhalt not doe; ſo there is another that will ſay as faſt, <hi>facies,</hi> thou ſhalt doe. Evill ſuggeſtion, evill example, our owne corrupt nature and ſatan, will egge us for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: therefore we muſt keepe a diligent watch, abridge our ſelves of things lawfull, we muſt flie from the ſmoke, from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evill, that the body of ſinne may not reigne in us. So in the ſecond, it argueth a continuall keeping of the law, ſo long as we live. A future tenſe not reſtrayned, bindeth a man for ever. it is for to morrow, and ſo to our lives end. Therefore our warfare againſt ſinne muſt be to blood, and to death: and before that we are not diſcharged of the law, as ſaith the Apoſtle to the Hebrews.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Mandatum pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum.</hi> The firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>

                              </gap>. The end of the law is, to make a man good. Here two things:
<list>
                                 <item>1. As farre as may be, the impediments muſt be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that we may keepe the law: as when a building is to be made up, or in miniſtring cure, or in caſting ſeed into the ground. If there be a tree that ſtandeth where the building ſhould be reared up, it muſt firſt be cut downe: or if the ground be not dry and ſteddy, its not meet for a building: ſo where the whole body is corrupt, or ſome member hath nothing but dead fleſh; as in bodily, ſo in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall phyſicke, there is firſt a cutting a way of the dead fleſh, then the curing. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.4. there is a laying fallow the ground. For this God hath provided in his Law, that the Commandements they run negatively; and that in the very beginning, there is a removing, <hi>Non habebis,</hi> thou ſhalt not have.</item>
                                 <item>2. The ſecond thing followeth, <hi>Prima primò,</hi> that that be done firſt, which is in order firſt: as in a building, the foundation is firſt; in the naturall generation of the members, the heart. This alſo is done, the firſt being, <hi>Thou ſhalt have no other Gods before me.</hi>
                                 </item>

We muſt firſt know what intent God had in giving this Commandement. The end of the law, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, to beget good. Its ſaid that the generall end of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. is the glory of God; of the firſt table, godlineſſe, holineſſe, or religion. Religion being an action, muſt needs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from ſomething: and ſo it doth. For that that it commeth from, is the ſoule of man; and principally from the ſpirit of it. In that regard it is compared, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35. <hi>Luke</hi> 6.45. to a treaſure-houſe, out of which good men bring good things; evill men, evill
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48000:65"/>things: for that as the furniture of any part of the houſe commeth from thence; ſo in like ſtate is it of outward worſhip of the tongue, the hand, the eye; it commeth <hi>de bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>, <hi>For out of the heart proceed evill thoughts, murders, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, fornications, thefts, falſe witneſſe, blaſphemies.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This then we ſee, in as much as this is principall, 1. Regard muſt be had of his ſpirituall worſhip: and its the ſcope of the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Its ſaid, that according to the ſuperiour end, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is eſteemed: <hi>quo prior finis, eo prior neceſſitas,</hi> the more principall the end is, the more prime the neceſſity. The firſt table, before the ſecond, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.27. man was made the end of the Sabbath, not the Sabbath the end of man: therefore the breach of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward part of the Sabbath muſt yeeld to the health of man. This is generall; the higher the end, the nearer the neceſſity. Therefore this precept is <hi>primae neceſſitatis,</hi> of chiefe neceſſity. This was never diſpenſed with, nor ever ſhall be.</p>
                           <p>Now we come to the ſecond. Which is the firſt rule in extenſion to the affirmative part of the Commandement.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The negative was, <hi>Thou ſhalt have none other Gods.</hi> The affirmative part is ſet downe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And in his allegation out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13.10.20. <hi>Thou ſhalt worſhip one God;</hi> or to anſwer the negative, <hi>Thou ſhalt have me alone for thy God.</hi> This is done in the third rule, which is the drawing of it into particular branches. The ſecond rule herein is beſt. Firſt, to follow the plaine order, and to ſee how many propoſitions will naturally ariſe out of it; and they be three: Firſt, we muſt have a God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, we muſt have him for our God. Thirdly, we muſt have him alone for our God. So you ſee, The affirmative as a propoſition, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of three propoſitions.</p>
                           <p>
                              <note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Propoſitiones primi mandati.</hi> The Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the firſt Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note>Firſt, that we ſhould have a God; the meaning of this, that we ſhould not be our ſelves Gods: (which was the beginning of all miſchiefe:) judging of good and evill by our owne choice: but to knowledge a ſuperiour nature, and of him to take our rules, to follow God and abſtaine from evill, and not to ſtand to our owne mind. 2. That this nature thus teaching us what is good and evill, and promiſing to bring us to the full fruition of all good things: by the contrary, we ſhould acknowledge him, and tie our ſelves to him. This acknowledging or tying our ſelves to him, is to have a religion; and ſo conſequently, that we ſhould worſhip him, and have our religion from him.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſecond. That we muſt have him for our God. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of it is this: that the gods of the Nations are nothing but Idols, and no Gods; and conſequently, that their ſervices are falſe. But <hi>Jehovah</hi> our God, who hath ſhewed himſelfe to be a true God, he is the God indeed; and his religion is the true religion: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that we ſhould give over them, and their religion: and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48000:65"/>our ſelves to him and his worſhip; and here is commanded true religion.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. That we ſhould have him alone. The meaning is, that there is not one of thoſe Gods, and indeed none beſides God, that hath revealed or can performe eternall bleſſedneſſe to us; or that can joyne with him, and helpe him in performance: but he alone is able and willing; and conſequently as he alone doth, and will do it, ſo he will onely have all the glory to himſelfe; he will have none to be joyned with him in it.</p>
                           <p n="1">
                              <note place="margin">Profaneneſſe. <hi>Peccata contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria virtutibus mandati.</hi> Sins contrary to the vertues of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements.</note>1. The ſinne of the firſt of theſe, of not having a God, but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing our owne mind, is called prophaneneſſe; when a man will have his owne liking in every thing, ſo that he will doe that onely that ſeemeth good in his owne eyes, when he will have no yoke, no cords, no bonds, but will breake them; giving credit to nothing but that which his owne reaſon, his God, perſwadeth him unto: and purſuing nothing but that his will ſtandeth well affected unto. And doe nothing but by his owne direction.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The ſinne of the ſecond is falſe worſhip, or whatſoever falſe religion it be, it pleaſeth the Holy Ghoſt here to call it other gods.<note place="margin">2. <hi>Cultus peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</hi> Strange wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</note> As in the Scriptures he calleth all evill by the name of ſtrange: as ſtrange fleſh, an harlot: ſtrange worſhip, idolatry: ſtrange gods, falſe gods.

That which <hi>Elias</hi> found ſuch fault with: namely, halting on both ſides, mingling Gods religion with others; following both God and Baal, as the Samaritans did, having an Altar on the one ſide of the Temple, and the image of an idoll on the other: joyning God together with other Gods and idols.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are three ſpeciall things that the divell ſhooteth at; and hath helpes in our nature to bring his purpoſe to paſſe; when he tooke upon him firſt, the name of <hi>(Belus)</hi> Belial (which is being without the yoke) that he would lay no yoke upon any, he would force him to nothing then that he was willing to follow himſelfe: and therefore this was his way in his firſt tentation, that <hi>Adam</hi> was now yoked, that he muſt be underaw, and that he needed a dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor; whereas if he would but taſte of the Apple, he ſhould be a guide to himſelfe, and ſhould doe whatſoever he thought good, and that he ſhould appoint good and evill himſelfe. This vaine licentiouſneſſe, wherein men according to their corrupt nature, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light diſſolutely to follow their concupiſcence, and in all things to ſit Judges, to define good and evill, is the greateſt way to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and a degree of profaneneſſe and Atheiſme.</p>
                           <p>So in the ſecond place, there is a marvellous deſire in us of cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting newneſſe; change for our eye; ſtolne bread, privy matters, ſtrange fleſh: and this he taketh hold of, and ſtrengthneth as much as he can: and where prophaneneſſe prevaileth, he faileth not of bringing them to a curious deſire to ſeeke beyond the truth, till at the laſt they finde a lye inſtead of it, ſuch as he brought <hi>Salomon</hi> to: who having the knowledge of true religion, as much as any man had, was not content with that, but fell to ſeeking after ſtrange
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48000:66"/>religions abroad:<note place="margin">

                           <p>In the third, there is alſo in us a great deſire to reconcile God and mammon: and though our Saviour ſaid flatly, that it was impoſſible to ſerve both; yet we ſeeke to the attaining of temporall commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, to have a Paradiſe here, and elſewhere.

This the divell miſliketh not; for he runneth not on <hi>ſoli, vel tantum,</hi> to himſelfe alone, or onely; for when he tempted Chriſt, and had promiſed to give him all the Kingdomes of the earth if he would fall downe and worſhip; his deſire was not that he onely ſhould be worſhipped, but that hee might be joyned to God, and have part of the ſervice with him.</p>
                           <p>Now the reaſons whereby theſe are forbidden:

And therefore the heathen with us confeſſe a maime in mans nature. But we know the cauſe of it, (being enformed by the hiſtory of the Bible, what befell to man:) namely, that it is by dealing with the tree, by being our owne chooſers: and therefore this chooſing of ours muſt be left, and we are to tye our ſelves to the will and choice of our ſuperiour nature, that knoweth beſt what is beſt for us.</item>
                                 <item>2. Of the ſecond, the reaſon is evident; that when we have a God, we ſhould deſire to have the true God: no man would erre, even they that bend themſelves to deceive others, cannot abide to be deceived themſelves. None would thinke that to be, that is not; or that not to be, that is.</item>
                                 <item>3. The reaſon of the third is, that there be ſundry things that a man cannot have but alone: in which number is a maſter. God therefore is to be had alone, elſe not. God ſo comparing himſelfe, to a maſter, <hi>Mala.</hi> 1.6. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters:</hi> the ſervice to a maſter, muſt be alone, or elſe not. <hi>Oſeah</hi> 2.20. where he maketh God to ſay, <hi>Sponſabo te mihi in fide,</hi> I will marry thee unto me in faithfulneſſe. As alſo, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. that he had eſpouſed the faithfull to one husband Chriſt. A maſter and husband muſt be had alone.</item>
                              </list> This is a 2. conſideration; for an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band alſo muſt be had alone. So the having of God is of like nature: either we muſt have him alone, or none at all. God in jealouſie, in the ſecond Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, hath a relation to this. If a farther reaſon be required; that will be ſure to ſerve, and that is, that the joyning of any thing with God, muſt needs abaſe him and his worſhip. For he being the excellenteſt nature in the world, all inferiour things, if they be joyned with him, abaſe him, and he will not be abaſed. Therefore this worſhip muſt be kept pure, without mingling it with any other worſhip. Whatſoever being of a nobler ſubſtance, if it be joyned with any viler thing, it is adultery. This for the three pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>

Therefore this muſt needs be ſtrange, to command us that we muſt needs have a God, a true and alone God. We muſt learn to diſtinguiſh of the word <hi>(have)</hi> and ſo we come unto the particular precept, <hi>non facies, Thou ſhalt not make.</hi> As we ſay, though a man take Armes againſt his Prince, yet ſhe is his Prince ſtill, and he hath none other: and this having is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſuperiority; yet he himſelfe hath her not, or at the leaſt will not have her, becauſe he accounteth her not his Prince. The like is betweene God and us: In regard of the ſuperiour, it is <hi>ferrea frons vel lex,</hi> an yron law; we muſt needs have him: and therefore it were beſt for us to have him. Yet in as much as we would exempt our ſelves from his ſervice and obedience; they that riſe up againſt him in the breach of any of theſe three propoſitions, with thoſe that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him not, or would not have him, they have him not. Its the courſe of the Holy Ghoſt, to uſe this phraſe in the Prophets, <hi>They had Baalim and Aſtaroth:</hi> Not that they were Gods, or any thing, but that in their account they had them for Gods, in the ſuperiour part.</p>

                              <hi>We are ſaid to have a thing</hi> (ſaith the Philoſopher) <hi>if it be knowne to be had.</hi> For if a man have treaſure digged in his ground, or in his Cellar, and know not of it; he hath it not.

Into theſe two parts, all the breaches of this fall.</p>
                           <p>Thou ſhalt have a God. <hi>i.</hi> Firſt thou ſhalt worſhip a God. <hi>Worſhip,</hi> in <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.10. doth expound, <hi>have,</hi> in this place. It was ſaid that the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall worſhip <hi>of God,</hi> or having of God, is the end and ſcope of this Commandement. The worſhip of the ſpirit or ſoule is divided as the ſoule is divided, and that alſo falleth into the diviſion of having.</p>
                           <p>The parts of the ſoule, as God maketh them, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. are reaſon or underſtanding, called the ſoule. 2. The affection or will, called the Heart. Therefore they are fooliſh ſchoolemen, that expound by the heart, the body of man. So the duety of the mind being to know, (as is aboveſaid in the treatiſe) of the heart and appetite to regard: love falleth right to this. But under the diviſion, for the well expounding of the parts; we muſt labour for the true ſenſe of this. Therefore as we know the parts of the mind, ſo we muſt know that theſe parts have their order. <hi>Vires animae ſunt ordinatae,</hi> the powers of the ſoule are ſet in order, ſaith the Philoſopher. The order is this; that we muſt know it before we can regard it and love it. For <hi>ignoti nulla cupido,</hi> there is no love of that we know not, the Philoſopher. That <hi>inviſa poſſumus cupere, incognita nequaquam,</hi> we may covet things unſeene, but never things unknown, <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> Therefore they ſay well, where two things be in order, if the firſt be taken away, the ſecond ſhall never be fulfilled. So if ignorance be brought in, God ſhal never be deſired, nor loved: and ſo not had.</p>

                           <p>The firſt kowledge: He muſt be knowne: and that ſtandeth firſt, the duty of the mind, and underſtanding part. 2. Love, he muſt be loved, eſteemed; the duty of the ſecond part, the heart or will.</p>
                           <p>Now the end of knowledge, is but the fulneſſe of perſwaſion, a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led beliefe, which we call faith; both the meanes and end of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And therefore comprehended in the firſt part: as the fulneſſe of regard and love is nothing elſe but obedience. But to make it more plaine: let the mind begin, that we may firſt know God: know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge muſt have its object, and that is God. He cannot be knowne <hi>à priore,</hi> in himſelfe; therefore we muſt ſeeke to know him <hi>à poſteriore:</hi> and that is, by his attributes and effects.</p>
                           <p>For his Attributes, they are thoſe ten ſet downe <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>His Majeſty, Truth, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nchangeableneſſe, Will, Juſtice, Mercy, Knowledge, Power, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>biquity, Eternity.</hi> Of theſe, two eſpecially are called principall, and concerne us moſt, his <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy;</hi> the other 8. are called <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muniter ad dno,</hi> common to two; becauſe they fall into theſe two alike. So knowledge in fulneſſe, 1. proceeding to faith, apprehendeth, 1. the Juſtice of God. 2. his Mercy: and beleeveth them both. Adde the other 8. to his <hi>Iuſtice,</hi> that he is of <hi>infinite majeſty, infallibly true, &amp;c.</hi> and they make it more perfect, and conſequently more fearefull: adde them alſo to his <hi>Mercy,</hi> that <hi>he that loveth us, is King of eternall life, &amp;c.</hi> and it maketh his Mercy more, and conſequently farre more to be beloved. Out of this faith or knowledge<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> proceeding of his juſtice, there proceedeth feare; and out of it humility. Theſe out of Juſtice, the firſt part; and out of the knowledge and faith of mercy, with the other 8. proceed two duties more: one hope, who would not hope? 2. <hi>Fructus ſpei invocatio, &amp; precatio eſt interpres ſpei.</hi> The fruit of hope, invocation, prayer is the interpreter of hope. By prayer or thankeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, <hi>i.</hi> to acknowledge from whom we have received it.</p>
                           <p>Love hath his effect and fruit. Love is full in obedience: which is a conforming of our ſelves and our will, to the Will of God. Or a bearing willingly of whatſoever it pleaſeth God to lay on us, for not conforming our ſelves to him in this life: and that is called pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>obedientia crucis,</hi> the obedience of the Croſſe. In theſe the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of God doth wholly conſiſt: and there can be no other duety added to them.</p>
                           <p>We muſt underſtand this, that it pleaſeth the Holy Ghoſt in the Scriptures, by the figure Synecdoche, for ſhortneſſe of ſpeech, ſundry times to name one of theſe, and thereby to meane and comprehend the whole worſhip of God.

We muſt either finde it out of our ſelves, or learn it of others For fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it of our ſelves, <hi>Ier.</hi> 10.14. hath taught us a leſſon: Every man is a beaſt by his owne direction: if he hath none to direct him but his owne naturall knowledge, he ſhall come to more groſſeneſſe and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, then the very beaſts.</p>
                           <p>We are all deſtitute of the knowledge of God by nature. So having no hope to finde it our ſelves, and being not like to learn it of others, becauſe all are thus affected, We muſt ſeeke to an higher teacher, that hath higher knowledge then we have: and he is ſet downe to us, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Deus ſcientiae Dominus, For the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him enterpriſes are eſtabliſhed.</hi> So then he can teach us, and of his will we be very ſure. He hath knowledge to teach us, and others: we muſt not looke for it elſewhere. <hi>Eſay</hi> 54.13. <hi>Erunt omnes docti à Deo, And all the children ſhall be taught of the Lord. Pſal.</hi> 36.9. <hi>For with thee is the well of life, and in thy light ſhal we ſee light.</hi> Though we are all blind, and have no light in any of our ſelves; yet in his light we ſhall ſee light. And therefore he can teach; and that he is willing we have ſeene before. The next thing is, that ſeeing we know where we muſt have our knowledge, to ſee, 1. whether we are willing to be taught: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be, ſeeing the neceſſity of it. 2. Whether God be willing to teach us. Gods willingneſſe in <hi>Iob</hi> is teſtified, that he hath written un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the reines of man. So he began it in <hi>Adam,</hi> he preſerved it in the Patriarks: and then it decaying, he taught it by traditions: after that, they being corrupted, and knowledge more decaying; he wrote the law:<note place="margin">If there prove no ſufficient knowledge, it is either on the teachers part, or on his that is taught.</note> being ſo written, it was broken at the foote of the Mount: when that was broken, he tooke order for a new writing: and in <hi>Deut.</hi> he taketh order for continuall practice of it, that they ſhould continue in the hearing of it. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.8. he gave it to the Levites to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret it to the people, and make them to underſtand it; and they

                              <hi>they have not known.</hi> 2. Its the cauſe of puniſhment for ſin, as <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5.13. he ſaith, <hi>that the captivity of Babylon was, becauſe they wanted the knowledge of God.</hi> And its not the cauſe of puniſhment, but as its the cauſe of ſin; and that is ſet forth to us in <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.22. <hi>Do not they erre that imagine evill?</hi> There is no ſin but there is an error: therefore planting of perfect knowledge would be a cutting away of many ſins, and <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non erratur, niſi ignorantia.</hi> There is no ſinning, but through ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.

They uſe to call it an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible ignorance; and its firſt in children, before they have the uſe of reaſon. And 2. in thoſe that want the uſe of reaſon, that are borne and continue ſo. And 3. in thoſe that by diſeaſe, or any ſuch thing, are bereft of the uſe of it; and that ignorance, they ſay, is not imputed to them. They adde a fourth alſo. <hi>i.</hi> where the means cannot be had. But if a man having the love of God in the heart, ſet himſelfe to ſeeke, he ſhall be ſure to find them. God hath even by revelations made them known, even to thoſe men that have made a conſcience of keeping the rules of nature. The other kinds are faulty.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. The 2. is affected ignorance. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 36.3. <hi>Noluerunt intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligere ut bene agerent. They would not underſtand that they might doe good.</hi> And its in thoſe ſpecially that are skilfull, that know that they are in a ſin, and are not willing to come out of it.

This is the concluſion, when a thing is made plain unto us, and we will not have it plaine, and ſo not ſee it, we fall into this kind of ignorance.</p>
                           <p>The 3. they call <hi>ſupina ignorantia,</hi> retchleſſe and careleſſe ignorance, the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon fault in theſe daies. This is, when a man <hi>habet à quo diſcat, &amp;

And as in theſe times, when almoſt the whole Land are guilty of it, if they be ignorant: ſo if it be in the ſprings of knowledge, it is moſt retchleſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. Its in thoſe that either through negligence or ſlothfulneſſe to know, or through ſhamefaſtnes to enquire, will not know. And this for ignorance. 2. The other is light knowledge.<note place="margin">Light knowledge</note> W<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> is full now in our daies contrary to that rule of the Apoſtle, <hi>Ro.</hi> 12.3. <hi>God hath dealt to every man the meaſure of faith.</hi> And that meaſure of faith is expreſſed, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Let the word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdome.</hi> Not only the whole abſence but the abſence of the meaſure of faith is condemned.

                        <p>An argument; it is a way of preparation, and therefore ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be handled, which is a ſpeciall part of faith and moſt effectuall, and is rather to be called <hi>Confidentia quàm fides,</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence then beliefe. It pleaſeth God thus to prepare us to faith, that a man muſt repoſe himſelfe wholly upon God, and he that can be brought to this <hi>etiam vacuo penu, when there is no hope of any good,</hi> and he altogether unfurniſhed of earthly meanes, that man will alſo be able to beſtow his confidence on God in heavenly things.</p>
                        <p>Now when the Storehouſe of meanes (that is) faith in theſe earthly things is empty, we cannot attaine to heavenly things.<note place="margin">So both are here enjoyned us, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wee have the meanes, or have them not, we ſhould beleeve. The truſt in God two wayes, either when it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him to give the meanes, or when wee are deſtitute of them: when wee have the meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to order that theſe ſhould be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of our actions, wee are to uſe them.</note> This faith, or rather confidence in God is conſidered two wayes, firſt, either the man that hath it, hath the meanes alſo: or ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he that hath it, is utterly without the meanes: If we have them, as we are willed, we are to uſe them, becauſe it pleaſed God to ordaine them as ordinary inſtruments to worke with; as <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.30. a good care in <hi>Jacob</hi> to provide for his owne Family. <hi>Thou knoweſt what ſervice I have done thee, and in what caſe the cattell hath beene under my hand; for the little thou haddeſt before I came, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed into a multitude, and the Lord hath bleſſed thee by my comming:</hi> But now when ſhall I provide for mine owne Family. As alſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.8. <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Iſaac, Iſaac</hi> ſpeaketh to his Father, here is wood, and fire, and the knife, but where is the Sacrifice? And <hi>Abraham</hi> anſwereth, God will provide us the reſt, my ſonne, he will provide a Sacrifice; if we will doe our parts, God will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the reſt. Therefore we muſt not doe as (<hi>Mat</hi> 4.6.) the Tempter would have Chriſt to doe; to caſt himſelfe downe from the pinacle of the Temple, when there was an ordinary way to come downe. For this were to neglect the meanes, and to ſeeke extraordinary meanes.</p>
                        <p>And as we are commanded to uſe them, and not preſume with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them: So on the other ſide, we are forbidden to truſt in them. Whether they be private to the Art we are in, which <hi>Habac.</hi> 1.16. expreſſeth by a Net, if we ſacrifice to our Net, that is, aſcribe that we have, to that within us; that is there noted as a fault and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. If we aſcribe all to our Wealth, and to that our hands get; as <hi>Job</hi> 31.24. <hi>If I made gold my hope, or have ſaid to the wedge of gold, thou art my confidence.</hi> verſ. 25. <hi>If I rejoyced becauſe my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was great, or becauſe my hand had gotten much.</hi> Or if we truſt
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48000:78"/>to great perſonages, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. <hi>He that ſaith to fleſh,</hi> that is, to great men, great perſonages, <hi>thou art mine arme,</hi> there ſhall a curſe follow, and fall upon him: and not onely to great Perſonages, but even to Common-wealths, and the ſtrength of them, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Some put their truſt in Charriots, and ſome in Horſes; but we will remember the name of the Lord our God;</hi> and to the Church, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4. if we truſt that we are of the Church truſt not in ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, ſaying, <hi>Templum Domini, Templum Domini, Templum Domini hoc eſt:</hi>
                           <note place="margin">Though wee heare dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently yet it is not enough unleſſe wee have a found judgment withall to judge of them. Meanes deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Gods grace, be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, for their naturall force worketh by his bleſſing. The meanes have a force given to them naturally, but the bleſſing, the lord keeps it to himſelfe.</note> or as it is, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.30. ordinary commers to <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Sermons, to heare the word of the Lord, and to jeſt at it: and to ſeeke in their hearts after covetouſneſſe, diligent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, not looking to an higher power to bleſſe the meanes; all ſhall be made ſinne to us, and here is our meanes to our deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore this is a ſpeciall thing to regard in them, as to uſe them well, ſo not to truſt in them. Which may be done two wayes. Firſt, by having a right judgement concerning them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by uſing them aright; ſo as we ſhew that we doe not thinke that for the good uſing of them, we ſhall be bleſt.</p>
                        <p>For right judgement, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3. God ſaith, it is not bread that a man liveth by, but his Word; that his eternall decree in nature is that bread that ſhould nouriſh us: but when he giveth his ſtaffe, it is that, that a man liveth by; and <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 42.6. the Prophet he looked on his Bow and on his Sword, and he ſaw that they could not helpe him, (for <hi>I will not truſt in my Bow, it is not my Sword, that ſhall helpe me</hi>) and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1.2. If the Lord adde not his buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, to our building; and his watching, to our watching; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther our building, nor our watching ſhall proſper: The Lord muſt give us the Staffe of building, watching, nouriſhing, &amp;c. or elſe all our meanes will be uſed in vaine; nothing can be without his bleſſing. Therefore we are to looke on bread, as on a ſtone; knowing that it is not that, but the word of the Lord that nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: and this muſt be our judgement of them.</p>
                        <p>For the ſecond, the <hi>uſing of them aright,</hi> becauſe this is true, that they are of no more force without a bleſſing annexed to them;<note place="margin">
                              <hi>Rectus uſus cauſarum ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cundarum,</hi> the right uſe of ſecundary cauſes. God muſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctify them, elſe there is nothing in them. If wee do not ſanctify Gods creatures, with thankſgiving, they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to our greater con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</note> therefore we are to ſeeke for a further thing, that may give force and ſtrength to them: and that is procured, and God ſhall give his infuſion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4, 5. if Prayer goe before, and hearty thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving, which ſanctifie them; and withall, that be provided, that our thankſgiving be not of courſe, a forme of words, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times begun and ended, before it ſhould have beene begun: This hollow harty thankes was that that <hi>Job</hi> feared in his ſonnes: for he knew, that by reaſon of his good and carefull education of them, that they did not omit prayer and thankſgiving any day; but he feared leaſt it came not from their heart, and their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and heart went not together: and therefore every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he offered burnt offerings according to the number of them. And doing thus, we come into the number of the Saints, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom we ſhall reade in the Scriptures, that they have uſed the ſame: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.9. <hi>Jacob</hi> uſing all the meanes that could be,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48000:78"/>in ſending meſſengers before to his brother, to tell him of his comming, thereby to know how his brothers minde was yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to him, and telling what they ſhould ſay unto his brother, and how to demeane themſelves, and uſing great pollicy in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating his wives and ſervants, &amp;c. that were with him, and the Sheep and the Oxen and the Camels, into two companies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding a gift for every one, &amp; ſetting them in order, that if his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came to one company to ſmite the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, the other company might flie and eſcape: yet we ſee, that in the ſame place he giveth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to prayer, thinking that all his meanes could not prevaile, nor ſhould be bleſſed, unleſſe God did add to his arme. So <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. all furniture for the warre is provided for the Iſraelites; <hi>Joſhua</hi> is their Captaine, all things are in order; but knowing that all this is not availeable, <hi>Moſes</hi> goeth up into the Mount, with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> to pray, with the rod of God in his hand, and <hi>Moſes</hi> is no longer praying, nor his hands are up, then the Iſraelites proſper and are victorious; and the Iſraelites are no longer victorious, then <hi>Moſes</hi> is praying, and his hands are lifted up.</p>

                        <p>So when a man is ſo rich, that hee is poore to doe evill; or a man is ſo wiſe, that he is fooliſh in evill; that man hath a good warrant that fleſh is not his arme, and that his truſt

This, as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 3.8. is the high mountaine, that ſtands in Chriſts way; and unleſſe <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> take paines to remove it, he cannot come to us.

                           <p n="1">1. For if a man will offer to any, that which ſhall be <hi>accepted,</hi> it is better if he offer ſomewhat of his owne, then of others: for that which we offer of our owne, is dearer unto us: and therefore hee to whom it is offered, taketh it better. In obedience, <hi>offertur propria vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas,</hi> I offer up mine own Will: and as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. the two ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſword divideth my Will, and pierceth it: and conſquently I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it up to God. In a ſacrifice <hi>offertur aliena caro,</hi> I offer up other, not mine owne fleſh.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. Againe, the better that a thing is, that is offered, the better it will be accepted; but what is offered in <hi>obedience,</hi> is better then that offered in ſacrifice; becauſe in <hi>obedience</hi> there is a live thing offered: a beaſt I cannot offer, but when it is killed. Againe, in a ſacrifice, there is but a brute beaſt, and unreaſonable: in <hi>obedience,</hi> there is a reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable ſoule, which is more acceptable to God.</p>
                           <p n="3">3. The third is this, the more ye give, the better it is accepted: in <hi>obedience</hi> there cannot be more given, then is given: In <hi>ſacrifice</hi> I give of the fruit of my cattell, a part of my fruit: but in <hi>obedience</hi> I give the fruit, tree and all.

                           <p n="4">4. Laſt, that that is offered, the longer continuance it is of, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is. In a <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> it is but two houres worke, while the fire is kindled, and the beaſt burned to aſhes: but in <hi>obedience,</hi> when I offer up my ſelfe to God, it is a <hi>continuall ſacrifice:</hi> it is a perpetuall morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of my Will, my Reaſon, and all my members. <hi>Obedientia eſt juge ſacrificium:</hi> therefore it is plaine that <hi>obedience is better then ſacrifice:</hi> not that <hi>ſacrifice</hi> ſhould be neglected or condemned; it is not condemned, when a better thing is preferred. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7.22.23. When the people was marvellous carefull that the Lord ſhould not be defrauded of his offerings and ſacrifices, God ſaith: I ſpake not to your Fathers, when I brought them out of the land of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that they ſhould ſacrifice: but this was the thing, that I ſpake to them for, that they ſhould obey my voyce: that is, in reſpect of <hi>obedience:</hi> That thing is not denied ſimply, which in compariſon to another is ſet far behinde it.</p>
                           <p>Againe, the excellencie and neceſſity of <hi>obedience</hi> appeareth in this, that though it be a good thing, or though neither good nor bad; yet for

A Prophet comes to one of his neighbours, in the hoſte, and willeth him to ſmite and wound him: the man knew it was unlawfull, and refuſed to doe it: but he delivered a meſſage from God: <hi>(Becauſe thou haſt not obeyed the voyce of the Lord, behold as ſoone as ever thou art departed from me, a Lion ſhall finde thee, and ſlay thee:)</hi> and for this his <hi>diſobedience</hi> a Lion ſlew him. Thus appeareth the excellencie of <hi>obedience,</hi> that it is able to change the nature of a good thing, and to make it evill: and evill, good. The laſt example is of Chriſt: who ſheweth the great neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of this vertue, in his <hi>Dilemma.</hi> Father, if it <hi>be poſſible,</hi> let me not obey: but let this Cup paſſe from me; if it be <hi>not poſſible,</hi> thy Will be done: and when one of theſe muſt needs have beene choſen; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>mori,</hi> or <hi>non obedire,</hi> to die, or to diſobey: <hi>elegit potius mori, quam non obedire,</hi> he choſe rather to die then to diſobey: and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhewed, that <hi>obedience</hi> is more neceſſary then life it ſelfe, and the breath we draw: and this his <hi>obedience</hi> recovered the world: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. as the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Saints, for it is the ſmall number of the <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient</hi> perſons, that are the pillars of the world: otherwiſe without them, it could not ſtand but fall.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Commandements of the firſt Table are divided into ſuch as concerne the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God; either inward, as the firſt Commandement; or outward, as the ſecond, third, and fourth. The outward, is either continuall, or for a time, on a ſet day: or, either private and publike, or publike one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. That for one day, and publike onely, as the fourth Commandement: The other continuall and private, teacheth either the outward geſture, <hi>In honore, reverentia, in geſtibus,</hi> as the ſecond Commandement: Or in praiſe, which is exhibited in ſpeech, as the third Commandement: Or elſe, concerning the manner of worſhip, in the ſecond, or the end, as the third Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                        <p>That part of outward worſhip which concerneth the manner of it, and behaviour, to behave our, ſelves in all parts of the body, and in externall ſignes, is diſtributed into the Precept it ſelfe; and the Sanction, which is brought in by way of a reaſon. <hi>v.</hi> 5. For <hi>I the Lord thy God, &amp;c.</hi> And ye know in Princes Lawes and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, after they have ſet downe thoſe things that they command, and that we ſhould doe; then they ſet this downe, <hi>Qui ſecus faxit, punietur:</hi> He that doth not thus, ſhall be puniſhed: And that is called <hi>Sanctio praecepti. i.</hi> the part of the precept that toucheth the corrective part, and ſheweth how we ſhall be corrected, that will not be directed by the precept.</p>
                        <p>The Precept is of two ſorts; for firſt, either it preſcribeth what manner of worſhip he requireth, in reſpect of himſelfe: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make, &amp;c.</hi> Or ſecondly, how we are to be affected to him in that manner ſo preſcribed: <hi>Thou ſhalt not how downe, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>That is as much to ſay, as God will have his honour in outward worſhip: but he will preſcribe it himſelfe: And ſecondly, he will require at our hands, that unto that manner of him preſcribed, wee ſhould every way behave our ſelves reverently. So firſt, he
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48000:133"/>will have <hi>modum à ſe praeſcriptum:</hi> And ſecondly, he will have <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verentiam exhibitam</hi> to that <hi>modus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>If we marke, as the other precepts ſtand, the other eight are very ſhort: This and the fourth may for their length be called Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, containing a long ſumme of words; and you ſhall ſee it was not without cauſe. For an inward honour to be given to God, all Lawes tooke ſome order for it; as <hi>Solons, Deos caſtè adeunto:</hi> and then againe for the keeping of their oathes, they were exact, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, and ſtrict. So the Heathen, they knew theſe two parts, but they knew not the other two.</p>
                        <p>And for the ſecond Table, they are altogether exact in it, the laſt excepted. But the outward manner of Gods worſhip, and the day of worſhip, were things blotted out in the time of Gentility; and were moſt groſly of all the reſt, tranſgreſſed. Then it is, becauſe theſe were in eſpeciall feare to be violated; and <hi>ergo</hi> it is not for nothing, that he uſeth ſuch order in them. For inward honour and keeping of the vow, we agree with Turks and Pagans: But this is it wherein we diſagree, the outward manner of worſhip; and this makes the diſtinction betweene Chriſts Church, and Satans Synagogue.</p>
                        <p>Let us come to the opening of the meaning of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement: <hi>Thou ſhalt not make, &amp;c.</hi> And as all the reſt, ſo this ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon a Synecdoche, under one generall, comprehending all the reſt.</p>
                        <p>The generall thing forbidden here, is not the making of a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude or graven Image; but a farther thing, ſet downe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> Invented worſhip, Will-worſhip, deviſed by man.<note place="margin">Will-worſhip.</note> For the energie or force of the Commandement, is in theſe words, <hi>non facies tibi;</hi> that is, wee muſt not invent any thing whatſoever: <hi>Non ſimulachrum, non imago damnatur, ſed, non facies tibi.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The invented, or will-worſhip hath two things in it to allure us unto it: they are both ſeene in the worſhipping of Images. Firſt, becauſe it hath a ſhew of wiſedome; that a man ſhould invent ſuch an excellent thing. When any man is thought to be wiſe, that he may bee taken to deviſe a worſhip for God. Secondly, it hath a ſhew of humility; that a man ſhould not caſt downe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before God, but before his Image, and Angels, &amp;c. as <hi>Paul</hi> ſetteth downe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.23. But if we ſo run, it will make us loſe our reward.</p>
                        <p>The affirmative part, or generall thing commanded, is ſet downe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.5. cited out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.40. That ſeeing God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed an order, we ſhould doe after it. It is ſaid, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was warned, as <hi>Moſes</hi> received an Oracle: See thou make all theſe things like the pattern of them that were ſhewed thee in the Mount, preciſely in every thing; in the length, breadth and faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſwerve not one whit, but doe all things according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne received. <hi>i.</hi> Becauſe God, after the delivery of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Law, ſhewed him every thing preciſely of the outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:48000:133"/>in every particular point; he giveth him a charge at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, <hi>ver. laſt,</hi> that he ſquare it according to the order that he had preſcribed. So the affirmative is, that our outward worſhip be as hee hath preſcribed it. We muſt make his word our pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne.</p>
                        <p>The negative, that we mingle none of our will-worſhip with his precept or worſhip; as it is<note n="*" place="margin">Theſe words may be taken of the inward worſhip alſo, but eſpecially it concerneth the outward worſhip of God.</note> 
                           <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. God ſpeaketh very generally; that hee will have a man <hi>Hoc tantum facere, quod tibi praecepero; hoc autem faciemus, ſi nihil addamus aut detrahamus.</hi> If we doe either, or both of them, it will follow, which is <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Fruſtra colet is me;</hi> Worſhip him we may, but we ſhall loſe our labour: <hi>Quis iſta requiſivit à manibus veſtris?</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The reaſons whereupon any thing is here denyed or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: 1. Seeing there is an honour to be given to God, and he will be worſhipped; the queſtion is, Whether it ſhould be given as wee, or as he thinketh good? And for this, <hi>Socrates</hi> in <hi>Plat.</hi> 7. <hi>Lib. de legibus,</hi> can tell us, that every god will be worſhipped, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, in that manner that beſt liketh him. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> alſo <hi>Homil.</hi> 51. on <hi>Matth. Qui honoratur, eo maximè honore delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, quem ipſe vult, non quem nos volumus;</hi> elſe, <hi>non eſt honor, ſed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decus, ſi vel contra, velpraeter mandatum aliquid fiat.</hi> When it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to mans worſhip, we make no queſtion of it, whether he be to be worſhipped and honoured in that manner that beſt pleaſeth him: but in honouring Great men, we endeavour to fit their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours: So then much more is it hard, not to allow God ſo much wiſedome, as to appoint himſelfe his owne honour, ſeeing we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it to man.</p>
                        <p>This then may be the concluſion, that <hi>Jerome</hi> ſets downe, that <hi>honos praeter mandatum eſt dedecus;</hi> that honour that we give contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the commandement of the honoured, or that he doth not care for, it is a diſhonour to the party, and no honour. This for the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; now for the particulars.</p>
                        <p>This being ſet downe, our firſt queſtion concerning that that God hath made choice of; is, Whether God will have us worſhip him with Images or not. In which there is a very meere <hi>tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio ſcopi,</hi> as the Logicians terme it, betweene us and the Papiſts, or Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> For whereas God hath delivered his will in theſe two termes, <gap reason="foreign">

But the reaſons they weigh thus much in the Chap: as if he ſhould ſay, If it had beene the will of God that there ſhould have beene any Image, he would have ſhewed you ſomewhat when he came into the Mount: but you ſaw nothing, but heard onely a voyce; take heed <hi>ergo</hi> that you correct not God, and make to your ſelves any Image. And as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. it is the nature of faith to be <hi>rerum inviſibilium,</hi> not to ſee: Now to bring viſible things into Religion and Faith, it is the next way to diſhonour God, and the overthrow of Faith and Religion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.23. Chriſt himſelfe tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Woman, that the time was come, when all Ceremonies and invented places for worſhip ſhould goe for nothing; and even the very Temple at Jeruſalem God would not accept it: But this was it that ſhould be accepted, that they ſhould worſhip him in ſpirit and truth; whereunto nothing is more oppoſite than I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages, no truth being in them, but onely the ſhew of a truth and viſible. Then they will aske, if all likeneſſes be condemned, why was then that of the Cherubims permitted? yea preſcribed by God to be made; for that was a reſemblance, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.5. But yet it was no ſuch<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 21.8. 2 King. 10.</note> reſemblance, as they define an Image to be, <hi>quod habet exemplar in rerum natura.</hi> For the Cherubims were made round like two young men or boyes, without armes, and in ſtead thereof with two wings. But for that matter it is plaine, that he made them, not to be worſhipped; but if he would have had them worſhipped, he would not have put them into the darkeſt place; but they were put into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> where none ever came, but the high Prieſt, and he but once in the yeare. And they were made, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. to this end, that the high Prieſt might know
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48000:135"/>from whence God would give anſwer. But <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>De Idololatria, Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 447. anſwereth this fully. God ſaith not, that an Image may not be made: But, <hi>non facies tibi,</hi> that we make not any to our ſelves. But they ſay then; Why did <hi>Moſes</hi> make an Image? and he hath that objection in the ſame place: <hi>Ait quidam, Cur ergo Moſes ex aere fecit ſerpentem?</hi> His anſwer is there, <hi>Quod idem Deus &amp; lege vetuit ſimilitudinem fieri, &amp; extraordinario praeſcripto aeneum ſerpentem fieri fecit. Tibi eundem deum obſerva: Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem habes, eam obſerva; quod ſi poſt praeceptum factum, ſine libidine fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceris, &amp; tu imitare Moſem. i. ne facias niſi &amp; deus te juſſerit: licuit deo legem ponere, licet ei quod vult; ſi idem deus diceret tibi, Facies, qui dixerat, Non facies, jure faceres.</hi> God by his generall law for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bade that any Image ſhould be made; then by an extraordinary cauſe, by an extraordinary priviledge of an extraordinary matter, cauſed an Image to be made: except you have particular comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement from God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> had, doe not you make any Image. Concerning this point we have ſhewed on Gods behalfe, what did move him to make this reſtraint: now it followeth that we ſhew that in regard of our ſelves, and our owne corruptions, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary this reſtraint ſhould be made. <hi>Tertullian</hi> in the ſame Book, <hi>De Idololatria,</hi> ſetteth it downe, that before the Flood, even during the dayes of <hi>Seth,</hi> the worſhip of God was corrupted with Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: and that <hi>Enoch's</hi> reſtoring, was nothing elſe, but the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the true Religion unto her pureneſſe againe; and that he is <hi>ergo</hi> ſaid in his dayes to have walked with God. This is it that <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith: For the likelyhood of it, ſince <hi>Adam,</hi> we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it that it was true; for <hi>Jacob</hi> by being in the houſe of <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban,</hi> had learned to take <hi>Teraphim,</hi> gods of Images, to mingle them with God. The reaſon of this is in <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. God will trouble himſelfe no more, nor ſet himſelfe againſt man; and his reaſon is, becauſe man is wholly evill, fleſhly: i. though hee conſiſt of two natures; one of fleſh and bones, the other of the ſpirit; yet he ſuffereth the groſſeneſſe of the fleſh to overgrow the pureneſſe of the ſpirit, and to corrupt it, turning the ſpirituall nature into fleſh: ſo that we wholly become fleſh; and <hi>ergo</hi> love that with which the fleſh is delighted, i. <hi>ſenſe.</hi> Inſomuch as the Apoſtles many times in their writings, and <hi>Paul</hi> giveth us warning to take heed of the fleſh of the ſoule; <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. The meaning of this is, that we have an affection in us; and that affection is called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, a deſire to feele or ſee him. This was Saint <hi>Thomas</hi> his diſeaſe, that would not beleeve, except he did feele his wounds, and ſee him himſelfe, &amp;c. And it was the diſeaſe of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> about the death of her brother: Maſter, if thou hadſt been here, he had not dyed. And we ſee it was not hers alone, but of all the Apoſtles; they deſired that Chriſt might ſtay to erect an earthly kingdome, and that they might be with him alwayes; inſomuch that he was faine to tell them, that except he were taken from them, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter could not come to them. Such a thing there is in Religion. In <hi>Exodus, Moſes</hi> had been in the Mount but a few dayes, but there
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48000:135"/>is a generall cry of the Iſraelites, a little after they came out of Aegypt: <hi>Fac nobis Deos viſibiles;</hi> make us gods that we may ſee, to goe before us. And this affection of mans nature to See, was the beginning of all Paganiſme and Idolatry. So ſaith <hi>Lactant. Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Orig. Erroris. Verentur,</hi> they feare leſt if they ſhould not ſee what they worſhip, they ſhould be thought to worſhip nothing at all. For <hi>Eſa.</hi> 36.7. ſuch was the conceit of <hi>Rabſhakeh,</hi> touching <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and the people of Judah, that they had no god at all; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had taken away the Idols, &amp;c. and there was no god to be ſeen. The very ſame thing in <hi>Serapion.</hi> They had a deſire of viſible gods; Where are your gods? You have no viſible gods, but onely bare Altars, as you had in the beginning. This deſire of ſenſe, was the cauſe of all evill in the primitive Church. Now then this was a ſpeciall cauſe.</p>

                           <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, the other dependeth on the firſt Commandement: For as in the firſt Commandement they had exceſſe, worſhipping what they ſhould not; ſo here in this Commandement they would not keepe a meane; they thought they could never have Monitors enow, to ſtirre them up to worſhip. So they would not holde themſelves to that meane, that God himſelfe had ordained, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Firſt, <hi>verbum Scriptum,</hi> the Scriptures: Secondly, <hi>Praedicatum,</hi> the Preaching of the Word: Thirdly, the viſible Word, i. the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: Fourthly, the great Booke of the creatures; of whom <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.1. Their ſound is gone out into all Lands, and their words unto the ends of the World.

Thus they gave the honour due to God unto creatures, which were not <hi>Divinae,</hi> but <hi>Humanae, Rom.</hi> 1.23. This is certaine, that ſeeing God had ſuch care of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he would never have forbidden Images, if they had been good for them to move them to the duties of worſhip; it had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to them if they had been ſo good teachers: no groſſer peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple then they.</p>

The writer of the Booke of Wiſedome (which hath as great authority as any of the Heathen) Cap. 14. ſetteth downe the reaſons how Idolatry grew before the comming of Chriſt; one of them was <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, a deſire and love of ſenſe; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch as there was nothing excellent in ſight, but it was corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. <hi>Rabbi Salomon</hi> of <hi>Labans</hi> Teraphim ſaith, that they ſignifie nothing elſe but an Aſtrolobe, or Mathematicall inſtruments of the Aſtronomers, having the proportion of men, as Dials, &amp;c. And a Teraphim in the beginning ſignified nothing but an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed in Aſtronomy. And the Syriake tranſlation of it, is a Mathematicall inſtrument. Thus they were brought to turne them to Images. So the <hi>Symbola</hi> amongſt the Aegyptians are armes and
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:48000:136"/>Emblemes, to diſtinguiſh countries; as <hi>Iſis,</hi> a clod with graſſe: ſhewing that part of the country to be fertile, and <hi>Ibis</hi> a dogge, ſhewing the wooddy country, and Images upon the tombes of the dead, as the <hi>Statuae</hi> dedicated to <hi>Belus,</hi> and <hi>Minos.</hi> And the cauſe of it was, becauſe <hi>they too much addicted themſelves to the ſenſes,</hi> as it is ſaid in <hi>Wiſedome.</hi> Though there came an occaſion that did helpe them forward, in this <hi>(viz.)</hi> to pleaſe their Princes, <hi>Belus</hi> for his vertues, and <hi>Minos</hi> then living: and then they came to be tyrannicall; worſhipping them at firſt of <hi>favour,</hi> as <hi>Belus</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos;</hi> they were afterward by edicts of Princes conſtrained to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip them for neceſſity. And this was before Chriſt; about which we agree with them.</p>
                        <p>Now ſince the time of Chriſt, they begin to ſtraine, a ſpeciall thing in the controverſie wherewith they thinke to daſh us, which is this, Shew us (ſay they) when Images came up firſt: And there is nothing more eaſie then to ſhew the beginning of Images.

Thus were they at firſt.</p>
                        <p>There were foure occaſions of the invention of them; two came up in perſecution, the other two, when the Church was in peace. <hi>Aug. Lib. contra Adimantum.

                        <p n="2">2. After this, that which is forbidden, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.28. (that which is an eſpeciall thing for the bringing in of Images.) It is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den alſo in the new Teſtament; many men for the great love they bare to their dead friends, to expreſſe their love and griefe, and for remembrance, would with hot Irons ſet markes in their face and
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48000:136"/>other parts, that it might continue as long as they lived; which is forbidden by the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.13. Yea, ſome of them would ſet up Images to remember them. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Mileſius</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> very learned and godly, dying, was ſo beloved of the Citizens and Clergy, as that when he was dead, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man would get his picture in remembrance of him, into their Parlors and Rings. And ſo he firſt came into their Rings, after in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Parlors; but afterward, as appeareth by the Epiſtle of <hi>Epiphanius ad Proepiſcopos ſuos,</hi> his Image was removed at laſt <hi>ad prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria,</hi> to the common places of judgement, and the Images of ſuch men; and from thence, as appeareth by the fifth Canon of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> into the high wayes, as Croſſes in memory of ſuch a one that dyed; and from thence to the Church-yards, then to the Chuch-walls, then to the Church-porch, and doore, and ſo at laſt into the Church, and to the Altar. Here was <hi>magnum ex parvis, ſed ex pravis principiis.</hi> And the like is to be feared of us; for we have them in our Parlors already. So we ſee the beginning and cauſes of Images in perſecution; firſt, a deſire to pleaſe: ſecondly, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate mourning.</p>
                        <p>Now in the peace of the Church, there fell out two other cauſes: Firſt, becauſe they would have their Church as rich as themſelves. For in the 2. <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell, <hi>Sect.</hi> 4. is an Epiſtle of a Noble man of <hi>Syria,</hi> that had built a Church for the Chriſtians, to one <hi>Nilus;</hi> he had made the Wals white, but not contented therewith, thought thereupon to have all the creatures of God painted; wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he deſired his advice. Who anſwered, that his advice was, there ſhould be no ſuch thing; but that he would be contented with the ſimpleneſſe of the Chriſtian Churches; but if hee would needes paint, he ſhould write nothing but the ſtory of the Bible, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Scripture; For it is ſeemlyer then beaſts, &amp;c. So that one cauſe was, by reaſon of their wealth, they deſired things pleaſant to the eye.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, another cauſe, in the ſame place, was that of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Nola</hi> in <hi>Campania:</hi> that having occaſion of a Journey into <hi>Syria,</hi> and ſo into Aegypt, and having none to preach to his people in his abſence; becauſe he would his people to have ſome teacher in his abſence, thought good to paint on the wals the whole ſtory of the Bible; (and did ſo) that they might preach to them; and ſo their Preachers and Schoole-maſters, were nothing elſe but painted wals. But this is not any way to be commended in him, and the effect was accordingly: For it ſo came to paſſe, that they grew to be ignorant, and had no other teacher but the very wals? And as <hi>Syrenus</hi> ſaith, becauſe their Paſtors began to wax dumbe Images, therefore their Images were their Paſtors. But it is certaine by the writings, that to the dayes of <hi>Hierome</hi> there was none ſuch. So is the reaſon of the ſecond Commandement.</p>

And in the Old, that of the Cherubims, and of the Serpent, is all they can ſhew for them; Unto which both, our anſwer is, <hi>ut ante,</hi> chiefly that of <hi>Tertullian.</hi> There were priviledges for them; if they can ſhew the like priviledge, for the Crucifixe, or any other Image in the New Teſtament, it is ſomewhat for them; <hi>Generi per ſpecie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> non derogatur:</hi> they have no expreſſe commandement for any Image.</p>
                        <p>Againe, the ends of both are otherwiſe; the Cherubim was not to repreſent God, but to be a place out of the Church, from whence God would give his anſwers, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.22. And the Braſen ſerpent being a point in Phyſick, not in Divinity; the end of it was health to the ſting with ſerpents: therefore they make nothing for the worſhipping of Images. But 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. when the Braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent began <hi>pati abuſum,</hi> to be abuſed, we ſee how he uſed it; Which ſheweth plainly how little affinity it had with this Commandement. So the Cherubs ſhould have been ſerved, if they had been abuſed by the people. But God had taken order for them; for none could come to them, but the high Prieſts, and that but once in the yeare.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, for the reaſons: 1. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, not onely in the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, but alſo in the Apoſtles; and in <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 33.18. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to ſee God, and he had nothing ſhewed, but his back-parts.
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:48000:137"/>This being condemned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3. and being not onely in regard of the people of God, that this made them draw every thing to Idolatry, but even in the heathen: <hi>Aug. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>de Civit. Dei. cap.</hi> 21. ſaith that <hi>Varro</hi> ſpyed it, that it brought great inconveniences to Religion: his reaſon, <hi>quia facile contemaere divos in ſtoliditate ſimulachrorum.</hi> It was alſo ſhewed 2. <hi>nimium,</hi> is a broad way to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition; and it is a vaine aſſertion of theirs, that there can be no <hi>nimium</hi> in Religion. And <hi>Aug. in Pſal.</hi> 101. ſcorneth it, and ſaith, that if we doe ſo, we may ſoone bring a rock into the Church, becauſe it did repreſent Chriſt too. So for the <hi>time</hi> when, and the <hi>Authors</hi> by whom Images began: we have ſhewed out of <hi>Ireneus.</hi> 1. that the Croſſe came firſt from the Valentinians, the Images of Chriſt and his Saints from the Gnoſticks, 1. <hi>Iren.</hi> 24. <hi>in Epiphan.</hi> 27. <hi>hereſ. &amp; Lib.</hi> 3. the Image of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyridians. <hi>Auguſt. in his</hi> 13. <hi>Booke contr. Adimant.</hi> giveth foure reaſons. Firſt, the policy of Hereticks, to claw the Heathen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, being themſelves inclined to them. Secondly, too much mourning for the dead, noted, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. Thirdly, the wealth of the Church. Fourthly, idleneſſe of the Miniſters; theſe were the cauſes of Images.</p>
                        <p>Now for the full handling of this queſtion of Images, we will ſee what can be further ſhowed for them out of the Fathers and Councells. Their Fathers are either <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>counterfeit.</hi> Truely al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for them, they have none, but onely <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Euſebius.</hi> And <hi>Baſils</hi> ſentence deceiveth <hi>Aquinas,</hi> and the Schoole-men. For where he ſaith, that the honour due to the <hi>abſtract,</hi> redoundeth and is due to the <hi>patterne;</hi> he goeth about to prove, that Chriſt is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with God, as he is the Image of God; and he ſpeaketh there of this concluſion: that Chriſt is to be worſhipped with the ſame worſhip, that is due to God the Father; out of <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. where Chriſt is called <hi>Character ſubſtantiae patris.</hi> If the Papiſts can ſhew us any ſuch Image of Chriſt, as Chriſt was of the Father; we will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, and worſhip it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Euſeb. Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>Cap.</hi> 4. in his Panegyr. to <hi>Paulinus;</hi> that he is with us: and in his Epiſtle to <hi>Conſtantia</hi> the Empreſſe; ſet downe in the ſecond Councell of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> the report he maketh there, is only of an Image of Chriſt that was ſet up by ſome of the Gentiles, for the miracle he wrought on the Woman of <hi>Syropheniſſa.</hi> Which maketh nothing for the Papiſts. For it is abſurd to ſay, The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did it, therefore the Chriſtians ſhould doe ſo.</p>
                        <p>Their counterfeit Fathers, are <hi>Athanaſius, Damaſus, Chryſoſtome. Athanaſ.</hi> in a certaine abſurd Booke, not his, but going under his name, concerning a Crucifixe, that wrought miracles. It is eaſie to be ſeen, whether it is his, or no. If there be any man that ſhall read it, he will ſay at the reading of one of the firſt periods, that it is farre from <hi>Athanaſius;</hi> nay, that it is farre from a man of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe. Such another is of <hi>Damaſus,</hi> in his Pontificall, in the life of <hi>Sylveſter.</hi> There is no more to be done in this caſe, but that which is ſaid, <hi>Noveris, oderis.</hi> To know them is ſufficient to make
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48000:138"/>us hate them, and never like them againe. Read the Treatiſes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So may we ſay of <hi>Chryſoſtomes</hi> Liturgy, as <hi>Juell</hi> noteth in it, that there an Emperour is prayed for by name, that lived ſixe hundred yeares after <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was dead; for they prayed for <hi>Alexis,</hi> whereas <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> lived in <hi>Arcadius</hi> his time.</p>
                        <p>Councells there are none for them, but <hi>Concil. Nicen.</hi> 2. in which were more unlearned and evill diſpoſed men, then in any that ever was. For the gatherer of this Councell together, was <hi>Jrene</hi> the Empreſſe; ſhe an Heathen borne, daughter of an Emperour of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> nuzzeled up in Paganiſme from her birth, till after matching with the Emperour <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> his Father, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted from her Paganiſme to the Chriſtian Religion; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently after his death, becauſe her ſonne was too young to take upon him the Empire, ſhe tooke it, in his name, ſoone after her converſion. <hi>Conſtantine</hi> at the firſt, ſeemed not to ſtand againſt her; but after when he came to any ſmall judgement, rather then hee would admit Images, loſt both his eyes; for he was after put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to priſon, and had his eyes pulled out: Whereby we may ſee that ſhe was a woman without naturall affection; ſubject to that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.31. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.3.</p>
                        <p>The chiefe ſpeakers in this Councell, were <hi>Tharraſius</hi> a Lay-man, Biſhop but of one yeare, and Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> all his life before, a Courtier: and <hi>John,</hi> Legate of the Eaſt Church; of whom we need no other witneſſe, then him for whom he was Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, who teſtifieth, he was a good devout man, but of no great learning. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> and <hi>Conſtantinus:</hi> Theſe ruled the whole Councell; and it may be truly ſaid, that in any one Councell, there were never ſuch a ſort of ſimple men, in reſpect of their gifts; and more evill diſpoſed, in reſpect of their boldneſſe and attempts, preſuming above their gifts. There is not in all <hi>Durandus</hi> Scripture worſe alleadged; there are not in the <hi>Legenda</hi> more fabulous Narrations, then in the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell.</p>
                        <p>There are in it ſuch errors, as they cannot defend. <hi>Action</hi> 2. there is a plaine concluſion, that the Angels are bodily ſubſtances. <hi>Action</hi> 6. that Chriſt was borne the five thouſand and firſt yeare of the World; and in the third, fourth, ſixth, and ſeventh, there is <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema</hi> againſt <hi>Honorius</hi> the Pope, for the Hereſie of the Monothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites: inſomuch that they cry out, the Councell is corrupted in all thoſe places. Laſtly, the councell is ranker on their ſide, and ſaith more then they would. <hi>Action</hi> 1. and 4. <hi>Non ſunt duae ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rationes, ſed una &amp; eadem adoratur, prototypus &amp; idolum.</hi> And <hi>Action</hi> 2. there is a worſe then this; <hi>Idem imaginibus honor debetur, qui &amp; beatae Trinitati:</hi> That is, that the adorations of the Idoll and the prototype are not two, but one adoration; that the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belongs to an Image, and the Trinity.</p>
                        <p>Now what they ſay on our ſide againſt Images.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, an heathen, <hi>Elius Lampridius, in vita Adriani,</hi> ſaith that he in a good affection was content to build the Chriſtians according to the manner of their Temples, bare Temples without any Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments:
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48000:138"/>Which were after denyed by the Senate of <hi>Rome;</hi> but it grew after into ſuch contempt among the Heathen, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of came a proverbe of them: If any of the Gentiles had built them a bare Temple, it was called <hi>Adriani templum.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">And for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>Firſt, <hi>Ireneus</hi> 1.24. cha. abhorreth them in the Gnoſticks and Euchits; they ſaid they had the Images of Chriſt, and <hi>Paul,</hi> and <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and of <hi>Pilate;</hi> and that as he left them, of the drawing of the skilfulleſt men in <hi>Jury.</hi> This he diſalloweth in them.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus,</hi> in his <hi>Paraeneſis,</hi> goeth too far, <hi>Nobis vetitum eſt omnino fallacem hanc pingendi artem exercere;</hi> he is ſo farre from favouring Images, that he will have all painting and painters taken away; calling it the cheating art of painting: and he alleadgeth this Commandement.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, <hi>Tertullian, in Apologetico; Nos adoramus oculis in coelum ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latis, non ad imagines &amp; picturas intentis.</hi> We adore with our eyes fixt on heaven, not bent upon Images and Pictures.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <hi>Origen. Lib</hi> 4. <hi>contr. Celſum. Celſus nobis objicit, quod non habemus altaria &amp; imagines; proſitemur, inquit. Celſus</hi> upbraids us, That we want Altars, and Images; We profeſſe, we doe ſo, quoth he.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, <hi>Arnobius, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contr. Gentes. Objicis nohis imagines; quid hae, niſi viliſsima fabrorum opera?</hi> Thou objecteſt Images unto us; what are thoſe, but the moſt baſe workes of Mechanicks?</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, <hi>Lactantius, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de origine erroris,</hi> wholly: there is nothing alleadged, but you may find it there.</p>
                        <p>Seventhly, <hi>Euſebius, Lib.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt. ad Conſtantiam Auguſtam;</hi> ſet down in the ſecond <hi>Epheſine</hi> councell. That ſhe muſt now require no Image of Chriſt, not as he is man, becauſe now his glory is much more, then when he was in the Mount; and yet then the Apoſtles were not able to behold him; much leſſe can then his glory, as he is now, be expreſſed. And in the firſt <hi>Epheſ.</hi> councell, <hi>Anathema ſit, qui Chriſtum ullo modo dividit.</hi> Let him be anathematized, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide Chriſt, one nature from the other; which an Image of him doth. And as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, 34. <hi>de moribus Eccleſiae, Omnino errare meruerunt, qui Chriſtum non in divinis codicibus, ſed in pictis parieti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus quaeri voluerunt.</hi> They deſerve to erre, who will ſeek Chriſt not in inſpired bookes, but on painted walls. And againe, <hi>In ſtoliditate crucifixi,</hi> they eaſily bring Chriſt into contempt: In the Crucifixe they ſhew that Chriſt ſuffered no more then the Crucifixe ſheweth; but he ſuffered in ſoule the paines of Hell, which no painter in the World is able to paint; neither doe they ſhew: and therefore they derogate from his paſſion, and the loſſe of that.</p>
                        <p>Eighthly, <hi>Ambroſe</hi> in his Booke <hi>de fuga ſeculi, chap.</hi> 5. <hi>Noſtra, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, Eccleſia, non novit has, &amp;c.</hi> Our Church knowes no ſuch thing.</p>
                        <p>Ninthly, <hi>Hierome,</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 4. &amp; 16. <hi>Nos vero unam tantum ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neramur imaginem, Jeſum nempe Chriſtum, qui eſt imago Dei patris.</hi> We worſhip onely one Image, Chriſt, who is the expreſſe Image and character of his Father. <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> in his preface to <hi>Hierome,</hi> ſaith,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48000:139"/>That till <hi>Hierome</hi> was dead, there was no Image received.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is one that they cannot abide, <hi>Haereſ.</hi> 79. and in <hi>Epiſt.</hi> to <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that comming into a Temple that had an Image of Chriſt, he rent downe the vaile, wherein the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture was, and pulled it downe; and told them, it was againſt all Scripture and reaſon. <hi>Aug.</hi> 34. <hi>de moribus Eccleſiae catholicae;</hi> in that chap. he ſeemeth to ſay, that ſome among the Chriſtians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan then in corners to worſhip Images. <hi>Novi</hi> (ſaith hee to the Manichees) <hi>eſſe in Eccleſia noſtra adoratores imaginum ſepulchrorum: ſed iſti viri proſeſsionis haec nec ſciunt, &amp;c.</hi> So branding Image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers with ignorance, &amp;c.</p>

After when the five hundred yeares were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, there was better hold for them, yet they had gaine-ſayers; <hi>Cyrenus</hi> the Biſhop upheld the matter, that he would not have them; ſo alſo in the yeare ſixe hundred, and ſeven hundred, there were <gap reason="foreign">

At the ſame time <hi>Conſtantius</hi> 4. <hi>Leo</hi> 3. <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippicus</hi> 2. ſet themſelves againſt them; It had entrance then, but it never got ſound ſooting till the ſecond <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell.</p>
                        <p>We have foure Councels for us.</p>

It is commonly expreſſed by the phraſe of the holy Ghoſt: <hi>Acts</hi> 3.22. by hearing of one Prophet, not adding nor detracting. A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up to you, like to me, &amp;c. The acknowledging
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48000:140"/>of Chriſt to be our onely Prophet; and that he hath ſet downe whatſoever is neceſſary, and to which, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.32. we are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to add, nor detract therefrom; nor to alter any thing. <hi>Deut.</hi> 2.11. nor of that that is commanded, to leave any thing undone, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32.</p>

                        <p>Firſt, Preaching the word. We ſee this hath been uſed alwayes; as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.19. he preached to the ſpirits that are in Priſon:<note place="margin">Preaching, a part of Gods outward wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; ever uſed in the Church</note> 
                           <hi>Noah</hi> a Preacher before the Flood. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.21. in <hi>Moſes</hi> time: <hi>Moſes</hi> hath them that Preach him every Sabbath day. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.10. the Prieſts office was to Teach, to burne incenſe, to offer Sacrifice. In the time of the Prophets, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 61.1, 2. And the ſame continued in the time of the ſecond Temple: <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.4. there was a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit of wood ſet up, and in it, <hi>Ezra</hi> preached. In Chriſts time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.16. Chriſt himſelfe, annoynted to preach the acceptable yeare of the Lord: and as he himſelfe preached; ſo <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15. a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion is there given forth to his Diſciples, Goe, preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell to every creature; and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. it is the fooliſh kinde of preaching that God hath made to overthrow the wiſedome of the wiſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, Invocation; as it is called <hi>vitulus labiorum,</hi> the calves of the lips, in <hi>Amos;</hi> is of two ſorts: 1. Petition. <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. <hi>ver. laſt,</hi> in the time of <hi>Enoch,</hi> then began men to invocate the name of the Lord, <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.7. and <hi>Exod.</hi> 8.8. <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> knew this; ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.11. &amp; 28.20. <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervants, and <hi>Jacobs</hi> prayed. But when the Church began to be gathered, <hi>Numb.</hi> 10.35. the Army of Iſrael never moved nor ſtood ſtill without Prayer; it never pitched, but it continued in Prayer. Riſe up O Lord, &amp;c. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne O Lord, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.22. At the building of the Temple, <hi>Salomons</hi> Prayer to bleſſe his Temple, that it would pleaſe God to grant a bleſſing. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 102. there is a generall Prayer. And <hi>Luke</hi> 11.12. an expreſſe forme of Prayer, taught by Chriſt to his Diſciples.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Thankſgiving is the other part, commanded <hi>Deutero.</hi> 31.19. Practiſed privately, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.27. after he had obtained his requeſt: Publickly, of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 15.1. a manifeſt forme of it. The ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall forme of it, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 95. And that Pſalme, and many other, the holy Ghoſt beareth witneſſe. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 7.6. the Kings uſed to ſing them. After, <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.10. in the time of the ſecond Temple. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 92. a Pſalme of thankſgiving. In Chriſts time, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. and when they had ſung a ſong, &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.19. ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalmes and Hymnes, &amp;c. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, Sacraments. The Word is the ſpeech that God hath to us; Prayer is the ſpeech that we have to God. This is the covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and us, <hi>Ge.</hi> 17.2. Circumciſion, <hi>Exo.</hi> 12. the Paſſover, the Sacraments of the law, ſeals of things to come, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. Baptiſme <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26.
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48000:140"/>the Supper of the Lord, the Sacraments of the Goſpell, ſeales of benefits paſt.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, Diſcipline. Commanded <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18. <hi>John</hi> 20.22. Executed extraordinarily, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. by <hi>Peter:</hi> Ordinarily, 1 <hi>Corinthians</hi> 5.3. by <hi>Paul.</hi> Rules for the full ordering of it, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the Ceremony. Of this we have foure Rules. Firſt, that they be not many, and thoſe neceſſary. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.28. there are onely foure ſet downe. Secondly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.26. that they be to edification, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.18. that the outward ceremony pull not downe that which the inward ſubſtance hath ſet up. And it is the reaſon, why <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> refuſeth that prayer that is made in an unknowne tongue.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, that it be for order, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.32. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out confuſion in the Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, according to order, <hi>verſ.</hi> 33. they broke order.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, that it be for decencie: in which reſpect he commandeth them that they come into the Church with their heads uncovered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4.</p>
                        <p>The fourth rule, The meanes: the rule for it; to keep the <hi>depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> that which is committed to us, as <hi>Paul</hi> willeth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.20. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding or detracting. It is ſtrange that they of <hi>Rome</hi> alleadge it, that Religion is <hi>depoſitu,</hi> that is, a thing committed of truſt: that we neither add thereto, nor detract from it; but we alleadge it, that we impaire it. And the meanes for that is, <hi>Joſu.</hi> 1.8. that God was ſhouldred up, by not letting the Law be loſt: Let not this booke of the Law depart out of thy mouth, but meditate therein day and night, that thou mayſt obſerve to doe all therein. The volume was either gone, or elſe corrupt, as if it had never come forth; therefore that the Legend thruſt it not out of the Church. They were wont to have the Legend read in the Church, and books of ſentences, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſcholaſticall ſums of the Schoole-men read among them that gave themſelves to Divinity, and none of the Scriptures. There was <hi>ambo in medio poſita,</hi> and nothing elſe but <hi>volumen utriuſque foederis</hi> laid upon it. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.17. As we muſt take heed that it goe not away; ſo that none come to it, that doe <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> of our <hi>cultus arbitrarius &amp; praeſcriptus.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.13. the Apoſtle interpreteth himſelfe; he chargeth him under a ſevere charge, that he keepe it <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; that there be not a ſpot in it, like the Lepers skinne. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. a little leaven will ſowre a whole lumpe; or as <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Wormewood will marre a whole Barrell of Honey. For the proceeding of this, the beſt way is, <hi>arcere coenaculis.</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 16.14. <hi>Uriah</hi> the Prieſt deviſed an Altar in all points like to that that King <hi>Ahab</hi> ſent from <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> and being made, brought and ſet it hard by Gods owne, the braſen Altar; and after that, brought it in further, betwixt the Altar, and the houſe; and at length it got the North-ſide of the Altar, that is, the upper hand: and ſo it will be; therefore we muſt take heed of this.</p>
                        <p>The fifth Rule, Signes. There is no better ſigne, then if wee
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48000:141"/>ſay, or prove nothing, but either as the Prophets did, <hi>Dictum Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovae,</hi> or elſe as Chriſt proved the Reſurrection, by a Syllogiſme, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.32. or as the Apoſtle, <hi>Quod accepiſtis; haud alterum quam accepiſtis: Quod accepi à Domino, &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. Theſe three are good ſignes.</p>
                        <p>The ſixth rule, Be acceſſory to procure this, that others doe it, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.12. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.2, 3. We muſt ſtand ſo affected to it, as that we be ready to breake downe whatſoever is contrary to it. But this muſt be underſtood of thoſe that be in authority; as <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 32.20. He tooke the Calfe and burned it in the fire, and grownd it, &amp;c. It was <hi>Hezekiabs</hi> office to breake the Braſen ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. Secondly, the private mans office is, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.24. not to bow downe to them, and to doe as the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.19. that is, Though they may not runne and pull them downe, yet they muſt not worſhip them. And ſo much for the firſt part, that is, the manner of Gods externall worſhip.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond part of the precept, is how we muſt be affected in this worſhip:<note place="margin">2 Part.</note> 
                           <hi>Thou ſhalt not bow down to them, &amp;c.</hi> For whereas it may be ſaid to the firſt part, thus; Where he ſaith, <hi>Non facies,</hi> I may an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Non facio: alius fecit, ego factum reperio;</hi> as we ſee, the Danites, <hi>Judg.</hi> 18. found in <hi>Michahs</hi> houſe an Idoll framed: and not that alone, but 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12. not a private man, but <hi>Jeroboam</hi> maketh a Calfe of gold. And <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> doth not onely erect an Idoll, but alſo commandeth it, on paine of death, to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Enough for the anſwer of this objection, is that that followeth, <hi>Non adorabis ea, neque coles.</hi> Howſoever they were made as thou haſt no part in making; ſo alſo in worſhipping thou muſt not have any part.

As in Latine, <hi>Colo,</hi> is not onely given to God, and man; but <hi>colore jus, vitam, glebam, hortum:</hi> And thereupon is <hi>Agricola</hi> called.

                        <p>We ſee the Commandement double, Firſt, of making; Secondly, of ſerving and bowing downe to Images.

But how evill this ſucceedeth with them, it may appeare by the records of antiquity; for this indeed was (but 'its varniſhed over a little) the anſwer of the old Idolaters in the primitive Church.

Idola.</hi> And this error is as ancient, as the Calſe in the Wilderneſſe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.32. and if we examine the caſe, it is all one with them. For the Iſraelites would not worſhip it, but God by and in it: For they did not thinke the Calfe to be God, or that God could be made, but they deſired onely a viſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of God; which may appeare by theſe reaſons: Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would have it to goe before them as <hi>Moſes</hi> did; and that was to repreſent God unto them: For <hi>Moſes</hi> was a viſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of God to them, and now they could not tell what was become of him. <hi>q.d.</hi> He whom we had as an aſſurance of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with us, is not to be found; therefore let us have in his ſtead gods to goe before us; Now either this reaſon muſt hold, or elſe <hi>Moſes</hi> was their god before. And they made a Calfe rather then any other thing, becauſe they knew no other ſhape of God, then they had of the Oxe, called <hi>Apis,</hi> in Aegypt.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, The aſſent of <hi>Aaron;</hi> if he had not had ſomewhat in his minde beſide Idolatry, he had not received that favour, but had beene deſtroyed with the reſt: For <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. the cry of the people,
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:48000:142"/>This is that that brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt, cannot be underſtood but that they tooke it onely as a repreſentation: and <hi>Aaron</hi> tooke great hold of theſe words of the people, and built an Altar, and conſequently made a feaſt to be held to <hi>Jehovah.</hi> And there <hi>Jehovah</hi> receiving a feaſt of them, ſheweth plainely that it was but a repreſentation of <hi>Jehovah;</hi> ſo that this was the <hi>Elench,</hi> that deceived <hi>Aaron,</hi> that they might worſhip God in it; but it could not ſo deceive <hi>Moſes,</hi> for he breakes it in pieces, and burnes it to aſhes and gives it to, &amp;c. Here the Romans fly to a third ſhift; they will not adore them, nor worſhip God by them; but they will be put in minde of God by them: the ignorant people muſt have ſomewhat to helpe them to remember God. This alſo is no new objection; but uſed of the old Idolaters; as we may ſee by <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> his words, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 44.10. there muſt be ſomething to put the ignoraut in mind of God.

                        <p>So we ſee there is nothing ſaid in this cauſe, but hath been ſaid before. Now if we aske them, that if the people muſt be put in minde, Of what it ſhall be? Not of the Deity, for they themſelves began to be weary of that defence: Yet it was a very uſuall thing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in ſhapes of men to reſemble God. And <hi>Hoſius cap.</hi> 66. <hi>in decalogum,</hi> ſaith and confeſſeth, that ſuch Images crept in, <hi>dormientibus Eccleſiarum praepoſitis &amp; paſtoribus:</hi> while the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſlept.</p>
                        <p>Then we muſt come to Chriſt; Firſt, if they ſay, this is the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Chriſt, they muſt picture God; for he is God and man. They cannot as he is God, becauſe his attributes are infinite, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he is man only; Therefore they doe as <hi>Neſtorius,</hi> divide the natures of Chriſt; and ſo conſequently runne into the Anathema of the firſt Councell of <hi>Epheſus.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, if they ſpeake of his manhood, as now it is; then <hi>Euſebius</hi> his anſwer to <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> his glory is now farre greater, then in the Mount where the Diſeiples could not looke on him; therefore neither of them can be exhibited by any Penſill.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, But they ſay, they will ſhew his ſhape as he was in the dayes of his fleſh. We anſwer, that their remembrance is evill; and as it is <hi>Habak.</hi> 2.18. they be teachers of lyes: ſo this Image teacheth us to forget by it; for the whole Church hath taught us, that Chriſt ſuffered more then we can ſee painted; that is, piercing of naylos in his hands and feet; a blow in his ſide, and thornes on his head; the eſpeciall paines and torments he ſuffered for our ſinnes, are forgotten: the heavy wrath of his Father, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out in in moſt full manner upon him; and ſo conſequently
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48000:143"/>the Image hath taught us to forget the greateſt part of his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                        <p>Then if they will come to a third point, that they will have a remembrance of the Sacraments; this is a new queſtion: that is, for the Sacraments themſelves, we muſt come to this; they are no better then the Angels; therefore, ſince the Angels have refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as the Angel, <hi>Revel.</hi> 22.9. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>; therefore it muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from men: And <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 96. ſaith of this very well; <hi>Si audirent angelos, diſcerent ab illis non adorare angelos.</hi> And we muſt remember the ſecond ſignes of feigned worſhip, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18. they have <hi>Speciem</hi>

                           </gap>, a ſhew of lowlineſſe, but will at length beguile us of our reward. Thus much of the continuance of it with the other, and for the delivery of it from error.</p>
                        <p>The affirmative part. The latter part of <hi>Exodus,</hi> after that <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> went up into the Mount, containeth the firſt part of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; that is, the manner of Gods outward worſhip. And <hi>Leviticus</hi> containeth the ſecond part, that is, how we ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have our ſelves in this worſhip. And as the firſt Commandement muſt have <hi>Internum honorem &amp; internam laudem;</hi> ſo this ſecond Commandement muſt have <hi>Externum honorem;</hi> and the third <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternam laudem,</hi> in word. So that Honour, whether it be <hi>ſigno</hi> or <hi>facto,</hi> is the thing commanded. The honour of the ſigne, in <hi>Tiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacaveh,</hi> in bowing downe; of the deed, in the word <hi>Servies, Mat.</hi> 5.15.</p>
                        <p>A candle is not lighted, to be put under a buſhell: the maxime the Fathers have gathered thence, is this; <hi>Bono debetur manifeſtatio;</hi> for candles, that have <hi>bonum lucis,</hi> are not to be thruſt <hi>ſub malo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebrarum;</hi> ſo that our candle muſt be put on a candleſtick, to bee made knowne: This is Gods will, that if we have the candle light in our ſoule and heart; that is, the internall worſhip; we muſt ſet it on a candleſtick; that is, we muſt bring it forth, and ſhew it by outward worſhip: it muſt not be a chamber godlineſſe. 2. We know that <hi>in copulativis, utrumque faciendum eſt;</hi> therefore we muſt next joyne that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, we muſt glorifie him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with our bodies: glory being nothing elſe, but a conſpicuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and enlarging of honour and praiſe; as to <hi>glorifie,</hi> is to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and praiſe externally; therefore it containeth honour in it. Then this is requred, that God be honoured both outwardly and inwardly; therefore he muſt be honoured as well with our <hi>bodyes,</hi> as with our <hi>ſoules.</hi> and the Devill knowing that God requireth both, doth therefore require the one, but the bowing of the body of Chriſt, <hi>Matthew.</hi> 4. becauſe hee knew, that if God have not the <hi>Copulative,</hi> body and ſpirit; hee will have neither of both.</p>
                        <p>The third is, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.28. and <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 4.17. or as it is in ſome Bookes, 5.1. in his Sanctuary, in times and places of religious exerciſes, wee muſt obſerve <hi>Utrumque pedem:</hi> if wee muſt have a care of our loweſt parts, much more of our eares and hearts.</p>
                        <pb n="273" facs="tcp:48000:143"/>
                        <p>This <hi>externus honor,</hi> is, either <hi>ſigni,</hi> or <hi>ſacti.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For <hi>Tiſhtakebeh,</hi> the ſignes be two, as the Apoſtle proveth Chriſts humility, by theſe two ſignes, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7, 8. the firſt is to empty our ſelves, and <hi>deponere magnificientam noſtram;</hi> as it is called in the wiſedome of men; ſo he being equall to God, made himſelfe empty of that magnificence, and gave the whole honour to God. For the magnificence of our ſelves is in reaſon and will: now if we can be content, though our reaſon ſhew us good reaſon, yet to ſubmit it to the reaſon of God, and our will to his will, ſo out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip and magnificence. <hi>Job</hi> 19.9. he hath ſpoyled me of mine honour, and taken the crowne away from my head: then to take our crownes, the beſt things that we have, and our glory, and to caſt it at his feet with the Elders, <hi>Reve.</hi> 4.10. is this <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi> So did <hi>David</hi> put off his Robes, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. and tooke the Ephod, and was contemptible in the ſight of <hi>Michall;</hi> but hee ſaid it was his duty to be vile in the ſervice of God: So <hi>nudatio capitis,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. For <hi>pileo donari,</hi> was a ſigne of honour, and peculiar to Free-men: It was the magnificence of the head; for ever after, <hi>ſi cepiſſet pileum,</hi> he became free. Which ſigne, if he laid aſide, he was ſaid <hi>deponere magnificentiam;</hi> and it is the ſigne of a ſervant, when he honoureth his Maſter; and it is that, the Apoſtle urgeth men ſhould uſe at Prayers and Prophecying.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the other is <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Humiliare,</hi> to make us neare to the ground. Firſt into this falleth <hi>Tiſhtacaveh:</hi> when we make that that is higheſt in us, nearer to the ground; this humiliation did the Devill require of Chriſt; God makes it a ſigne of his true wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.18. in the ſeven thouſand that had <hi>not bowed the knee to Baal</hi> outwardly. And <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.9. this is his quarrell againſt them, becauſe there was a carved Image, and a man bowed himſelfe to it; ſo the contrary is condemned and plagued.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. For honour <hi>facti,</hi> that is, ſervice: wee have two parts ſet downe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.9. in the Centurions ſervant, and commended of Chriſt. Firſt, I ſay to one, <hi>Goe, and he goeth; Come, and he commeth;</hi> that is, to be at commandement. The ſecond is, <hi>Doe this, and he doth it;</hi> that is, to doe his worke. In theſe two reſpects Chriſt will ſay to ſome in the day of judgement, <hi>Neſcio vos;</hi> But how can, or ſhall he ſay ſo, but as a Maſter to his ſervants, or a King to his Subjects? but onely as they come into his juriſdiction? and then this <hi>Neſcio vos</hi> ſhall be pronounced either to thoſe, which never came to his houſe of Prayer; or come of evill will, not to doe his worke: and ſo either they have nothing enjoyned them; or hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, he is not made knowne to them, nor have any part with him. The one is, of not being preſent; the other, not doing the Maſters buſineſſe. <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.1. God calling <hi>Abraham,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently anſwereth, <hi>Ecce ego.</hi> This is that that God requireth; we muſt be preſent at his aſſemblies. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 84.4. ſetteth downe his affection in himſelfe; that before he was called, he had a great longing to goe into the Lords houſe: When he is called, then you know what Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.7. Then ſaid I,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48000:144"/>Loe I come: the ſame readineſſe ought to be in us; Wiſedome, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. Becauſe I have called, and yee refuſed; therefore I will take pleaſure in your deſtruction. So they that refuſe to come, being invited, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.8. are pronounced unworthy. The manner of comming <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.17. it muſt be <hi>mature,</hi> and <hi>verſ.</hi> 34. <hi>quotidie,</hi> earely and dayly to waite at his doore, and ſo ſhew our ſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to be called.</p>
                        <p>For ſervice, <hi>Luke</hi> 17.8. the property of a ſervant is to doe his Maſters worke; and ſo as he preferreth his Maſters worke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his owne: that is, his Maſters worke ſhall be done firſt, and then his owne. And <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. we ſee the practice of it in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> ſervant: Hee would not eate, till his Maſters worke was done: and under this falleth the commandement of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the great worke, <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.5. God ſaith he hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> to ſerve him at the Altar; ſo that ſervice, is the ſervice of choyce; howſoever ſome account of it. That de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire ought to be in every one.</p>
                        <p>The outward behaviour in the outward worſhip was in bowing downe, and in ſervice; that is, for geſture, <hi>honor ſigni,</hi> which we call a reverent behaviour, it had two parts: Firſt, the laying downe of whatſoever ſigne of excellency is in us: ſecondly, a drawing neare to the earth. The other, <hi>honor facti,</hi> which is in ſervice, which is properly called devotion or devoutneſſe; that is, the prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and readineſſe of our will and of our ſelves to ſerve God. By the ſervice of God, we ſhewed what was meant, by a diviſion not given, but yet approved of Chriſt: firſt in going and comming when we are bidden: Secondly, in doing his buſineſſe, preferring it before our owne.</p>
                        <p>For the making of this more manifeſt and plaine, and applying it to the former parts; you ſhall underſtand, that the Prophet, in <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 95.6. (which our Church hath uſed as an antepſalm, or introduction to the ſervice of God) that there is placed, firſt, a comming; ſecondly, a worſhipping; thirdly, a falling downe; fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a kneeling: whereby we may ſee, that in the ſubſtantiall parts of the ſervice of God, firſt, in Prayer; ſecondly, hearing the Word; thirdly, adminiſtration of the Sacraments; fourthly, in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcipline; but in the two former eſpecially, there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a due geſture and manner of behaviour. And firſt this, as we have our direction according to the councell of <hi>James, Cap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. to take the Prophets for examples: And 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.6. that Women are to attire themſelves, as holy Women in old time: Then laying downe this, and it being the approved practice of the Church; we ſhall finde that they never came without exhibiting ſome reverent externall behaviour both in <hi>acceſſu &amp; receſſu,</hi> both in comming, and going; For their comming together, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.12, and 13. <hi>Salomon</hi> comming into the Temple of God, and ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Altar, they all worſhipped toward the Prince, and he himſelfe before all the Congregation kneeled on his knees, and ſtretched out his hands towards heaven and prayed. For their
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48000:144"/>departure, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.29. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> a devoute King, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple departing; they all bowed to the earth and worſhipped: And ſo they went to the Lords Temple, and returned: Then this is the firſt; there muſt bee a reverent behaviour in acceſſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe.</p>
                        <p>Now in particular, for our preſence. 1. in prayer, ſeeing it commeth, as was ſaid, partly from humility, partly from hope; the outward behaviour is to bee conformed to the inward af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection; therefore in prayer, there is an outward ſigne and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour.</p>
                        <p>
                           <note place="margin">Behaviout in Prayer.</note>Firſt, for humility; there muſt be <hi>depoſitio magnificientiae,</hi> which is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.4. With uncovered heads; in prayer and prophecy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and that <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>The other part in humiliation, making our ſelves neare to the ground, in kneeling at prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Abraham</hi> firſt did it to the three men, and his ſervant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.26. taught by him, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the like duty. In the Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.27. the people bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves and worſhipped. In the Prophets time, <hi>Solomon</hi> and the people, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.58. the Prophets, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Daniel</hi> knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led three times a day and prayed. After the ſecond Temple, <hi>Ezra,</hi> 9.6. <hi>Ezra</hi> fell on his knees, and ſpread out his hands to the Lord. Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.41. The Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.40. <hi>Peter</hi> kneeling downe, prayed. <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 3.14. For this cauſe I bow my knees, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.36. When he had thus ſpoken, he kneeled downe, and prayed; there, the whole Church of Epheſus, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.5. Wee kneeled downe on the ſhore, and prayed. So we ſee our patterne; if we take the Patriarchs, or Prophets, or Chriſt, or the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, or the whole Church; and if we doe thus, we ſee what our duty is.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The word in Hebrew ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth ſervice, which is alſo in ſtanding.</note>True it is, that becauſe not onely in kneeling, but alſo in ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before another, there is a phraſe of ſervitude; becauſe they are both ſignes of ſervice; therefore in many places we reade, that the geſture in prayer was ſtanding; and that ſome prayed ſtanding; we ſpeake now of it, as it is a part of ſervice; as <hi>Gehezi</hi> ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> before the Lord; and in no other reſpect. <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 19.27.

                        <p>Secondly, for the ſigne that hope bringeth; <hi>Oculus elevatus expectat; manus elevata petit, &amp; poſtulat,</hi> a lift-up eye hopeth and expecteth, and a lift-up hand beggeth and asketh; therefore we lift up our eyes and hands.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is the effect of hope, the ſecond, the effect of prayer; therefore theſe two geſtures are uſed in prayer; and it is uſed in that part of prayer which is called <hi>Petition:</hi> otherwiſe in <hi>depreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for herein our eyes may be caſt downe, with the <hi>Publican, Luke</hi> 18.13.

He lift up his eyes to heaven; which ſhew that it was the uſuall behaviour ſo to doe. So for the hand, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.11. When <hi>Moſes</hi> held up his hands, Iſrael prevailed: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.2. Let the lifting up of my hands be an evening ſacrifice: and 88.9. I call dayly upon thee, I ſtretch out mine hands unto thee. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. lifting up pure hands. Theſe examples are ſet downe for our inſtruction. In this part there is an evill and corrupt cuſtome come up in our Church: <hi>Baalam</hi> would not ſuffer <hi>Balak</hi> to ſit, but to ſtand by his burnt offering. To pray ſitting and covered, not war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by any place or example in the Scriptures; In regard of the Angels, we ſhould be reverent.</p>
                        <p>For outward behaviour at the miniſtery of the Word, it is plaine, that in the Old Teſtament, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.31. my people ſit before thee; ſo in the New, <hi>Mar.</hi> 3.32. the people ſate about him. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.17. and 10.39. <hi>Mary</hi> ſate at Jeſus feet, hearing his preaching: and <hi>Acts</hi> 20.9. there ſate in a Window a certaine young man, &amp;c. that it was lawfull for them to ſit; as alſo, ſtanding, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.5. When he opened it, all the people ſtood, &amp;c. But this hath been a thing alwayes indifferently uſed; and permitted to all eſtates at the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Word, to ſtand or ſit.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, for the adminiſtration of the Sacraments; the very action ſheweth plainely it ſelfe, what behaviour ought to bee uſed.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, for Diſcipline, and the executing of it, it is plaine; the judge is to ſit, the other to ſtand; and ſo it is manifeſt by the courſe of the judgements of the Law.</p>
                        <p>It pleaſeth God to ſet downe theſe things for us; one end may be taken out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. that we might glorify God with our bodies: And a ſecond end, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16.7. that our outward geſture might ſtirre up our ſoule; and that our hearts might learne the duty of our outward parts: And a third, out of 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. and <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.10. not onely to ſtirre up our ſelves; but alſo for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of others; that they ſeeing our reverent behaviour, may fall downe with us, and be moved to doe that, which at any time they ſhall ſee in us. So we have gone through two parts of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                        <p>Now the negative is nothing elſe but the oppoſite of this that hath been taught and delivered. As if a man come with a proud eye, and behave himſelfe proudly in his ſervice: as it is, <hi>Pro.</hi> 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48000:145"/>a proud eye is the firſt and chiefeſt of the ſeven things that God hateth. And if hee hate it at all times, much more at that time.</p>
                        <p>To the ſecond is ſtiffeneſſe, When wee are not willing to fall downe and worſhip, and to give him the honour and reverence of our eye, head and knee.

                        <p>For the doing of the worke, and in the firſt place, (for the chiefe part of his miniſtery is of purpoſe declined, becauſe it hath beene long time in controverſie, and is as yet:) to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our worke, and behaviour in the ſame worke, five points are conſiderable.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, the ſervice of God in the Liturgie: <hi>i.</hi> whether it be not the will of God, as his rule is, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.33. to ſtay one for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that inward unanimity, and outward uniformity, be not a delight to God: <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.12. he without the wedding garment, when he was found unlike his fellowes, and not uniforme in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parrell; therefore he was ſeparated from them, and condemned to be caſt into utter darkneſſe.</p>
                        <p>So at that time that the Church doth pray or ſing; when any one doth not pray or ſing with the reſt; it is a ſeparation and breach. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.2, 3. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is a City compact in it ſelfe; and the ſpirituall compacting no doubt is an eſpeciall commendation of the Church: and it is that, that is ſo often ſet downe in the <hi>Acts.</hi> Together with one accord, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. They were all <hi>with one accord</hi> in one place: When they heard, they did it together; when they ſung, they ſung altogether, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 34.3 and let us magnifie his name together in <hi>idem.</hi> As if the whole Church were one perſon; and had but one lippe: The ſeparation of tongues and lippes, a curſe of God; and the earth was bleſſed in this reſpect, when it was ſaid to be <hi>Unius labii,</hi> that it had but one lippe; as this was a curſe. So that in <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.2. And it ſhall be an eſpecial bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> that the <hi>Elders</hi> and all that ſtand before the throne, ſhall lift up their voice together, and with one conſent, ſing. This is a thing that the Fathers in their ages have much beate upon. Wee ſee how highly it is extolled, by <hi>Chryſoſtome:</hi> That it ſmiteth upon Heaven and the Lord, as a ſhowre of Haileſtones; and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> concerning the ſinging of praiſe, ſaith, that it ſoundeth in the Lord eares, <hi>tanquam re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonantia Maris,</hi> even as the Sea: And hee ſeemeth to take it out of <hi>Revelations</hi> 14.2. and I heard a voyce from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the ſound of many waters, &amp;c. Then this is the firſt thing.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, that whereas the ſervice of men: therefore much more, the ſervice of God, ought to be, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.5.
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48000:146"/>in ſingleneſſe of heart, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 2.18. <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> with feare and trembling: even to men. But in our exteriour ſervice of God there is ſo little feare, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch want of feare, that commonly we ſee that thing, which is contrary to feare; namely, ſleepe: which cannot concurre with feare; and our ſervice cannot keepe us from it: like the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, which could not hold up their eyes, being with their Maſter <hi>in Horto.</hi> But <hi>Jacob,</hi> which feared his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſlept not all the night. The example of the Apoſtle was remembred as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall thing in the primitive Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. that the Chriſtians watched and heard <hi>Pauls</hi> Sermon <hi>media nocte.</hi> Of which <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ad hoc commemoravit eos, qui vigilabant media nocte, ut condemnet eos, qui dormiunt medio die;</hi> and that we may know how farre we are from them, whoſe ſeed we follow. Now the actions of a naturall man, being firſt, <hi>cibus;</hi> ſecondly, <hi>potus;</hi> thirdly, <hi>ſomnus;</hi> meat, drinke, and ſleepe; ſleepe condemned by the ſame reaſon of the Apoſtle, by which he condemneth the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther two, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. becauſe we have houſes and chambers to ſleepe in. His reaſon there is, The Church is not appointed to that uſe, that is in private houſes; therefore ye ought not to eate and drinke in the Church: Have yee not houſes to eate and drinke in? What, contemne yee the Congregation? Apply it to ſleepe; we have our chambers and our houſes, to that end, to ſleepe in: Deſpiſe yee the Church of God? And as from the place; ſo wee may reaſon alſo againſt it from the time; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.7. he exhorteth to wake; <hi>Nam qui dormiunt, noctu dormiunt:</hi> but wee ſay and ſee, <hi>Qui dormiunt, die dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unt:</hi> Naturall reaſon telleth us, that <hi>Actio veſtita indebitis cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiis,</hi> miſ-circumſtanced actions are unlawfull. <hi>Eſay</hi> 5.27. there the Prophet, as his manner is, after the denouncing of a curſe on a careleſſe people, falleth into a bleſſing of the new Church: <hi>Non dormiet quiſquam nec dormitabit. Marke</hi> 13.36. Take heed, that the Lord, when hee commeth, take you not ſleeping. As alſo we may ſee what loſſe the Church hath by ſleepe: <hi>Cantic.</hi> 3.1. ſhee ſlept and awoke, and found not her Beloved; and wee know not whether God will forſake us ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly in it, or not. As after this, of the Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.40. ſome departed; nay, all left him, ſome forſwore him; this meaſure of apoſtaſie is to be feared. But howſoever it ſtandeth in reſpect of Gods puniſhments and mercies; yet the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer reaſons doe condemne it; but eſpecially, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.32. The heart rightly affected, is, <hi>ARDENS COR,</hi> and a Father ſaith, It is not poſſible that <hi>Sub gravi Oculo</hi> ſhould be a burning heart.</p>
                        <p>Againe, ſeeing every ſinne is to bee weighed and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>In primo partu, &amp; prima poena;</hi> as of diſobedience in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> Murther in <hi>Cain;</hi> unlawfull marriage in the old World; Pride in <hi>Sodome:</hi> ſo in the New Teſtament, unreverent hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, puniſhed in <hi>Eutiches, Acts</hi> 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. and in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48000:146"/>that after it forſooke their Maſter. And this is the ſecond ſigne.</p>
                        <p>The third is, that our hearts be preſent; Many there be, that outwardly watch, yet their geſture teſtifieth to all that looke on them, that they are <hi>praeſentes abſentes.</hi> Where the heart is abſent, it is impoſſible but that the outward members ſhould give a ſigne of his abſence. If we have <hi>Cor fatui, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.6. it will be in the houſe of mirth; the minde runneth on the place where his ſport lyeth: and ſo as <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.7, &amp; 14. <hi>Non dilatabit ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiam, non quaerit ſcientiam,</hi> as the wiſe heart doth, which doth not let knowledge paſſe: but <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 21.14. the inner parts of a foole are like a broken veſſell, they can keepe no knowledge; it runneth out as faſt as it is powred in: the wiſe, not ſo; <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 21.17. They inquire at the mouth of the wiſe man in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and ponder his words in their heart. That the fooles heart is ſuch, as <hi>ante,</hi> will be teſtified by ſome ſigne, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 17.24. by having his eye in all quarters and corners; not as they, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.20. that faſtned their eyes: nor an eye ſearching out the places of Scripture, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. and his hands and feet will tell you that he is not preſent, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 6.13. And when he heareth his fault reproved, it is but a laughing matter, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs</hi> 14.9. to behave himſelfe in this ſort, <hi>Patrare ſcelus hoc.</hi> And it is nothing to heare, except we looke how we heare, and be attentive, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.18. or be affected, as <hi>Lydia</hi> was, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. To give an eare, is nothing; but to give a wiſe eare, <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb.</hi> 18.15. and 3.13. and happy is he that ſpeaketh to a wiſe and underſtanding eare, <hi>Proverbs</hi> 25.12. it is compared to a gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den earing. The fooliſhneſſe of the eares of this Generation is ſuch, that you ſhall ſee the ſame attention given to him that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth out a ſort of words, as to him that telleth us the meſſage of God.</p>
                        <p>It is a ſore plague and often repeated in the Scriptures, <hi>Eſay</hi> 6.10. a fearefull place, repeated by Chriſt, <hi>Matthew</hi> 13.15. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.12. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.10. <hi>John.</hi> 12.40. <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.8. beſide three times in the Prophets: Give this people an heavy eare that they may heare, and not heare; give them a fat heart. This is the extremity of his wrath, and a heavy curſe: and ſo to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If it be true, and the heathen could ſay, <hi>Pietas non eſt vultu lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denda, ſive ſerio ſive ſimulate;</hi> then our owne reaſon will lay on us an hard rule of framing our geſture, when <hi>haec pietas</hi> is in place.</p>
                        <p>The fourth, That we talke not in the time; for that is cleane oppoſite unto it, not to allow unto it ſo much as ſilence. <hi>Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> 4.17. When yee come into the houſe, be ready to heare, and not to offer the ſacrifice of fooles; to prate and talke, <hi>Joh</hi> 29.21. If I ſpake, every man gave eare, and there was not a word: a note of reverence in them; for if any man ſhould turne from us, to talke with another, whileſt we tell him a tale, wee will thinke hee maketh little regard of us: and

                        <p>Firſt, becauſe that as <hi>Deut.</hi> 25.2. the puniſhment muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the fault; and the ſinne againſt the firſt Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is hidden, and in the wombe, in our hearts and boſomes, that God onely can ſee it, and view it: therefore the puniſhment of it alſo is left to God; and <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. he is content to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee it. But this, becauſe it comes into the light of the Sunne, and is to be ſeene of every body; in this reſpect God hath more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly pronounced a puniſhment againſt it, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.20. that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may feare. According to the rule of juſtice: <hi>Malum ubi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingit ibi moriatur:</hi> if the fault be open, ſo ſhall the puniſhment alſo be: if private, ſo alſo. And ſeeing this is committed in the ſight of all, therefore to be puniſhed in the ſight of all.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, that whereas every puniſhment is brought in, <hi>Ut prohibeat impetum ad turpia:</hi> and our <hi>impetus</hi> or inclination be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing marvellouſly whetted to the breach of this, by profit and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the beſt Oratours, annexed to it; I ſpeake of that corruption, wherein every head is full of new platformes, that it will deviſe to it ſelfe; and that we cannot be vile in our owne eyes, as <hi>David</hi> was, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. but of this, that ſometimes it falleth out as God fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.9. that the Beaſt getteth place, and then he that will not receive the marke of the Beaſt in his forehead, he ſhall neither buy nor ſell; and not that onely, but hee ſhall be rent in pieces: Here then is the motive, that man can be content to leave God, and bow downe to the Beaſt, if they can be perſwaded, they may thereby enjoy temporall commodities, and ſecurity of this life; for come what Religion will, they are ready for all. And in regard of the comming with theſe reaſons, not onely of that the Devill counted a great thing, <hi>Job.</hi> 2. the ſaving of mens <hi>Skinnes,</hi> but the <hi>Fleeces</hi> alſo, peace and tranquillity; ſo becauſe this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit was annexed, it was neceſſary there ſhould be a puniſhment, <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibere impetum hunc,</hi> to ſtop our inclination.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, becauſe we ſee, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.6. &amp; 6.8. and <hi>Acts</hi> 4.18. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts and Commandements contrary given out: <hi>i.</hi> for receiving of a falſe invented worſhip; that men ſhould at the ſound of the Trumpet fall downe and worſhip the golden Image; elſe to be caſt into the middeſt of a hot fiery Furnace: And that who ſo ſhould pray to God within thirty dayes, ſhould be caſt into the Lyons denne; And an edict that the Apoſtles ſhould ſpeake no more in Chriſts name. Therefore it was neceſſary that God ſhould give a countermaund, and a contrary edict: And that as Princes ſay, <hi>Qui ſecus faxit,</hi> he that tranſgreſſeth, ſhall forfeit this and this: So God ſhould ſay, If you will not bow downe and give me this worſhip, you ſhall forfeit you and your children after you, and your childrens children ſhall be ſubject to mine indignation.

                        <p>Firſt, we learne, that we are of dull ſpirits, not feared with Gods proper names, of juſtice, &amp;c. but he muſt take other, of raging men; ſo jealouſie we feare: but when we heare that God is juſt, we heare it without any great motion.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, that of <hi>Tertullian, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Marcion: Utitur Spiritus hoc vocabulo, ad exaggeranda ejus ſcelera:</hi> that ſinne is ſo odious a thing, and ſo vile; that if it were poſſible, would make God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and to be, that he cannot be.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, it is the Apoſtles uſe, that he maketh of the juſtice of God, as we ſee in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.29. he proteſteth himſelfe to be jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that we our ſelves might be jealous: that is, that every man enter into his owne heart, and conſider what God is; and ſay thus: What ſaith God, that he is jealous? let us conſider what God is; and againe, what we are; how excellent hee is, and how vile and wretched creatures we are. Why then, it ſhould appeare, that this ſhould pertaine to us, and not to him; and rather of our ſelves and our owne ſalvation; there is nothing worthy in us, that he ſhould be jealous of. And this for the entry to the thing.</p>
                        <p>Now to the thing it ſelfe: <hi>Viſiting the finnes, &amp;c.</hi> This commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation hath two things:
<list>
                              <item>1. The cenſure of the ſinne:</item>
                              <item>2. The puniſhment.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>The cenſure is by two names: Firſt, by hatred; for if it bee love that maketh us to keepe the Commandements; then it muſt be hatred that maketh us to breake them. But can any thing hate God?</p>
                        <pb n="286" facs="tcp:48000:150"/>
                        <p>The nature of God is eſſentially good,<note place="margin">Solut.</note> nay goodneſſe it ſelfe, which can no way come to be the object of hatred. Againe, ſundry of his effects come from his love; and they are ſuch, as the very wicked love them; and him for them, becauſe he beſtoweth on them their being, life, ſenſe, moving. But there is another kind of effects that proceed indeed from his love; by which he would have us preſerved; and ſo conſequently he giveth us Commandements, <hi>Cohibentia voluntatem inordinatam:</hi> that bridle our licentious will, and theſe are they that make him to be hated of us. For when a man is given to his owne will, and is drowned with the zeale of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, then he muſt needs hate thoſe Commandements, becauſe they are adverſaries, and contrary to his will and affection: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, God commeth to be hated, by too much love of our ſelves. For it would have all our deſires to be free to our ſelves; and any that doth oppoſe it ſelfe, it hateth it. So then, as God ſaith, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.5. Your eyes ſhall ſee it, and you ſhall ſay, The Lord will be magnified upon the borders of Iſrael.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, I have loved you, ſaith the Lord: And ye ſay, Wherein haſt thou loved us? Was not <hi>Eſau Jacobs</hi> brother? yet I loved <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> and hated <hi>Eſau;</hi> and made his Mountaines waſt, &amp;c. Expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.13. to be nothing elſe, but that he did not chooſe <hi>Eſau.</hi> Then are we ſaid to hate God, when there ſtandeth a caſe betweene his will, and an inordinate affection of ours; when his will is not choſen, but our inordinate affection is preferred, and our minde: <hi>Hoc eſt odiſſe deum, deum non eligere.</hi> For God loving us, it is the will of God, that when the queſtion commeth, his loving being ſo exceeding good to us, as that it challengeth us wholly; and that love is <hi>Vinculum conjugale,</hi> and therefore the love of the Lord ſhould be <hi>Amor conjugalis;</hi> which hath no third thing: but <hi>aut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat, aut odit; non eſt medium, Mat.</hi> 6.24. either he muſt love, or hate: <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.16. the Maids father ſhall ſay to the Elders; I gave my Daughter to this man to Wife: and he hateth her, &amp;c. and chap. 24.3. And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, &amp;c. treating there of love betweene married per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: he ſaith, If a man marry a wife, and hate her: that is, ceaſe to love her, and begin to be weary of her. If ſhee be not onely and wholly loved, ſhe is hated; becauſe theſe duties are joyned to one alone: there can be no third thing.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. The other name, which God calleth <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> iniquity, perverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; peeviſh and perverſe: the having of it, is to meete with the opinion and cenſures of men: as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.14. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> to the three Children: What diſorder is this in you, that you will not ſerve my god, nor worſhip the golden Image that I have ſet up? For the obſerving, and not tranſgreſſing of this Second Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, they were called perverſe fellowes, and diſordered Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: becauſe they obeyed not the Kings decree. Therefore God ſheweth the truth, who are diſordered; even thoſe that are breakers of this Commandement; and ſo it ſhall be found at the judgement of judgements at the laſt day of judgement.</p>
                        <pb n="287" facs="tcp:48000:150"/>
                        <p>God ſaith, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.2. A man muſt not follow a multitude to doe evill: his reaſon is, becauſe in doing ſo, he ſhall become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe. But the voice and judgement of the world is cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. But the reſemblance of it, that is commonly made of the Fathers, is of a pond full of Crabs, a perverſe ſwimming fiſh: for ſhe ſwimming backwards, and a fiſh that were caſt into the pond, ſhould ſwimme right: they would charge her of not ſwimming right; becauſe ſhe ſwimmeth not backward, as the reſt. But God, Chriſt, the Prophets and Evangeliſts, the Apoſtles tell us it is not ſo: but that they are diſordered that breake this Commandement. And this for the cenſure.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now for the puniſhment. It were enough to be found among the hated of God: but God moreover addeth here a viſitation: the meaning of it we haue, 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.16. the word betokeneth the Circuit of a Judge: as <hi>Samuel</hi> went his Circuit year by yeare: to <hi>Bethel, Gilgal,</hi> and <hi>Miſpeh:</hi> and judged <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And out of our owne practiſe, or as we our ſelves terme it, the Viſitation of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop. And becauſe <hi>viſitare,</hi> is to goe to ſee, it preſuppoſeth ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſo an intermiſſion: and it doth very fitly reſemble the judgements of God. For the forbearing of them, as it is <hi>Luke</hi> 19.44. <hi>Dominus requiret de manibus veſtris,</hi> he will require it at our hands, to know the time of our viſitation. As there be ſome that ſay, the Lord is long a comming: ſo there be ſome that ſay, he will not come at all. That ſay, <hi>Non requiret Dominus,</hi> as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 10.12. therefore, for the patient waiting of the juſt, for the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and glory of God, that they may know that it's a ſure thing that he will come as a Judge: and though he be long a comming, yet at the laſt he commeth, and then he taketh order: ſo certaine we ſhould be of the requiring of our ſinnes, at our hands, though he ſeeme as though he would not come at all.</p>
                        <p>The viſitation of God we find to be fitly reſembled to this his judgement: as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.25. a viſitation in outward goods: <hi>Let his habitation be voide,</hi> &amp;c. Againe for tranſgreſſion, a viſitation vpon the body. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.14. <hi>vpon the child.</hi> In the taking away of Gods benefits, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.42.43. And yet a more greivous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, <hi>quando paena odii eſt odium.</hi> And as God ſaith thus, <hi>qui ſordeſcit, ſordeſcat adhuc;</hi> ſo he may ſay, <hi>qui odio me proſequitur, odio me proſequatur adhuc.</hi> For it is the moth and conſumption. He viſiteth the ſinnes of the fathers on the children, &amp;c. that is, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Devill playeth the Sooth-ſayer in <hi>Peter, Matth.</hi> 16.22. <hi>parce tibi Domine,</hi> let none of theſe things come to thee: whereas they thought to haue ſaved themſelves by this means: God ſaith, As neither they, ſo neither their ſons after them, nor their ſonnes ſonnes, their ſonnes nephews ſhall eſcape.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, for himſelfe; They thought the Devill had given them good counſell: but <hi>Deuter.</hi> 7.10. God proteſteth there, that he will pay it to his owne face that hateth him. 2. And on his children, when he thinketh he hath beſt provided for them, then he pulleth downe evill vpon them. The which craft of ſinne, to make
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:48000:151"/>us beleeve we avoyde ſuch an evill, by that, by which we bring it vpon vs. The Devills prophecie, good counſell: ſo that when the wrath of God hath conſumed him, it taketh hold on his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: <hi>Pſ.</hi> 79.5. he will be angry ſtill, like fire: and ſhall goe along to the third and fourth generation.</p>
                        <p>Now to conſider the grievouſneſſe of the puniſhment, we mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it by three things: 1. <hi>a Gravitate.</hi> 2. <hi>a Multiplicitate.</hi> 3. <hi>a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixitate.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>For the greatneſſe &amp; grievouſneſſe of it, it's ſaid, that it ſhall be upon the children: which are in accompt with the fathers, as themſelves: <hi>Luke</hi> 8.41.42. he fell downe at JESUS feet, deſiring helpe; becauſe his only daughter lay a dying; and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.38. <hi>miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rere mei;</hi> for my ſonne is ſicke: and 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.33. they were ſo deare, that the father would redeeme their life, with the loſſe of his owne: as there <hi>David</hi> could for his rebellious ſonne <hi>Abſalom: vtinam pro te mortuus eſſem.</hi> This ſheweth that the thing is very deare to them. They are our worke, and not as <hi>Abrahams</hi> well, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.25. (werein, when it was taken from him, he thought he had wrong:) but a part of our ſubſtance, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23. bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and not that alone, but a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall part of the ſubſtance: <hi>Zerang,</hi> the ſeed and the beginning: as though it were but the chaffe, after the children were borne. Againe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.6. Childrens children are the crowne of their Elders, our crowne while we live: and as the heathen man ſaith, our image and remembrance, when we are dead.</p>
                        <p>For <hi>multiplicity;</hi> that, that is, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.47. the diſtinction there by many and few ſtripes: is here for the multiplicitie, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foldneſſe, three or foure generations.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>continuance</hi> and length. <hi>Mar.</hi> 12.40. They devour widows houſes, under pretence <hi>prolixae orationis: ideo erit eis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lixum judicium.</hi> Long judgement ſhall wait on them. So it is here: the whole memory of man: a generation. So long as a man can remember: ſo long as the mind of man can endure, he ſhall be puniſhed: and as he can have any abiding in this life, or as he can have any to beholde it after him. Hereby wee ſee it verified, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.20. that it is a fearfull thing to fall into GODS hands. And <hi>Pſ.</hi> 44.20. we ſee how the godly accompt of it. It is ſo fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that the godly had rather abide death, then breake this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. That is, that martyrdome is rather to bee choſen, then to tranſgreſſe that, which he hath preſcribed in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement.</p>
                        <p>Here may be a queſtion concerning the juſtice of this viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Whether one may juſtly be puniſhed for anothers offence? Where we note, that the very word, which proceedeth out of the mouth of GOD, is not free from miſtaking minds: and therfore let not this diſcourage any. And thoſe words, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.2. <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.29. They ſhall ſay no more, Our fathers have eaten ſoure grapes, &amp;c. Riſe they not as a ſcoffe of theſe words?</p>
                        <p>That which ſeemeth to ſtand againſt this, is <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.16. every
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:48000:151"/>one muſt ſuffer for his owne offence: and he ſaith not here, he will puniſh the child for the fathers offence: but that hee will viſit the fathers offence on the child: ſo neither the contrary, he will not puniſh the father for the child: ſet downe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.20. <hi>anima quae peccaverit, morietur. Gal.</hi> 6.5. Every one ſhall beare his own burthen: and 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. Every man, at the judgement ſeat of CHRIST, muſt receave the things done in his body, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>For the making of this plaine. Underſtand, that this is the courſe of many learned men, eſpecially of the Schoole-men; They ſay, as to the place of <hi>Eſa.</hi> 38.1. to <hi>Hezekiah;</hi> Put thy houſe in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: that as there is meant, <hi>non quid ſuturum eſſet, ſed quid ex deſpoſitione naturae futurum eſſet:</hi> by nature, thou art to die: ſo here GOD ſpeaketh, <hi>non quid ſaceret, ſed quid ex diſpoſitione meriti ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri ſaceret.</hi> But this would make <hi>neglectummandati:</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination would be vaine. On the other ſide we will proceed on this order.</p>
                        <p>Whether it be a thing unjuſt, that one man offending, another ſhould be puniſhed? I ſay not for his offence: for ſo it is not.</p>
                        <p>There be three reſpects in puniſhing:
<list>
                              <item>1. <hi>Satisfactio.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>2. <hi>Medicina.</hi>
                              </item>
                              <item>3. <hi>Correctio.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>By theſe three a man may juſtly be puniſhed; and yet no offence committed by him.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for <hi>ſatisfaction:</hi> as in ſuretiſhip: when the debt pertaineth to one man, and his friend taketh it upon him, and beareth the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment: is this injuſtice? <hi>Abſit.</hi> For then that which CHRIST hath done for us; to wit, our Redemption, ſhould be of none effect. But voluntarily one may ſatisfy for another, yet no wrong done to juſtice, nor yet puniſhment taken for the offence of the other.</p>
                        <p>Seco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dly, for <hi>medicina;</hi> may it not be as in the body? For the eye &amp; the head is ſicke, and the arme is let bloud for it: for otherwiſe the whole body might be brought into danger. So then it is not only a <hi>juſt</hi> thing, but alſo a <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Therfore, If puniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t be ſent <hi>prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter medicinam,</hi> as a medicine, another may beare it, without breach of juſtice, as it is in Phyſicke; that that is deprived muſt be <hi>leſſe</hi> then the thing for which it is deprived: as a <hi>Finger</hi> to be given for an <hi>Eye:</hi> this is a good medicine. So <hi>temporall</hi> things are to be given for the recovery of <hi>ſpirituall:</hi> temporall puniſhment may be taken on the ſonne, for the recovery of the father ſpiritually.</p>
                        <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. For <hi>correction.</hi> In that (as before) there is a reſpect to this: the amendment of the <hi>equality</hi> broken. A man ſhould deſire no more than GODS will is: but we ſee daily he doth: Therefore, hee breaketh <hi>equality,</hi> and is to make amends for it. Therefore, he muſt break ſomthing leſſe, that he deſireth; and ſo there is equality, when <hi>nimis</hi> is puniſhed with <hi>minus.</hi> For this equality of it, it muſt be in the <hi>father,</hi> and in the <hi>child:</hi> if equality be not broken in them, here is no injuſtice. For the <hi>Fathers</hi> ſay, <hi>fruſtra requirit debitum, qui non impendit indebitum:</hi> to require a debt, and not to pay that that is
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:48000:152"/>due is no juſtice: as GOD ſaith, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.6. <hi>Do ye ſo reward the Lord, O fooliſh people, and vnwiſe! Is not he thy father that hath bought thee!</hi> He hath made thee, and proportioned thee: and <hi>qui contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtat patrem ſuum, merito contriſtatur à ſilio ſuo:</hi> that is, If we being GODS children grieve him, it is a good right we ſhould be grieved of ours. Another is that <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. in regard of the viſible Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in the Sacrament: he is the GOD of <hi>vs</hi> and <hi>our ſeed:</hi> ſo when the father breaketh the Covenant, he ſaith out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.25. Let this mans bloud be <hi>ſuper nos, &amp; filios noſtros,</hi> upon us, and on our children.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To the <hi>ſonne:</hi> firſt ſure it is, and all agree in it, that in a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall puniſhment, becauſe <hi>filius</hi> is <hi>res patris, a poſſeſsion of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</hi> therefore, he may temporally be puniſhed, the body may be puniſhed. <hi>Deut.</hi> 1.1. in regard of the Covenant made with us and our ſeed; it muſt ſuffer as we doe. But for warrant of the equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; his <hi>nature</hi> is it that GOD findeth, as <hi>Cantic.</hi> 2.15. the Church findeth a neſt of <hi>young</hi> foxes, they have yet deſtroyed no vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, nor worried any lambes: but if they <hi>grow</hi> up, ſure it is, they will doe both. Now the queſtion is, Whether the Church may ſay, <hi>capite nobis vulpeculas,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>take us theſe young foxes.</hi> Becauſe there is a poyſonous nature in the ſcorpions eggs, therefore, we may tread them under-foot. And it ſtandeth with juſtice. For <hi>Pſ.</hi> 51.5. As ſoone as ever the ſeed is warmed, it <hi>conceaveth</hi> ſinne, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as ſinne commeth, there is no way to recover it: DEUS <hi>tui, &amp; ſeminis tui,</hi> he is not only our <hi>quod,</hi> but the <hi>quod</hi> of our ſeed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, juſtly may it be deſtroyed. Then there is no way to recover it; but by contract of <hi>marriage;</hi> for that, as <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 2.2. GOD hath ſent them a bill of divorcement: <hi>Plead with your mother; for ſhe is not my wife, nor I her husband: but let her put away her fornications out of her ſight, &amp; adulterers from betwixt her breaſts:</hi> And ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently they have no intereſt in the Covenant: becauſe, as its <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.6. <hi>They have gone a whooring after them that are no gods:</hi> after gods of ſtrange lands: and <hi>Job.</hi> 31.12. it is ſaid, It ſhould be a fire, that ſhould devour to deſtruction, and root out all his increaſe.</p>
                        <p>Then there is a <hi>third</hi> thing to be put to both theſe: name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a <hi>propagation</hi> of this ſinne: by an <hi>education,</hi> whereby every one is delighted to bring vp his owne children, as he himſelfe was, as 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>we doe like our fathers.</hi> Our fathers have worſhipped <hi>Baal,</hi> and we do ſo alſo. <hi>Symmachus</hi> ſaith: That Religion that commeth to us, having continued thus many yeares, let vs keepe it ſtill. And the propagatian of this ſinne proceedeth as it were a leproſie. If it once take hold in the father; it continueth in all the poſteritie: yet GOD, when he <hi>executeth</hi> this judgement, <hi>exequitur chirographo ſuo, non paterno;</hi> it is for his owne debt, not for his fathers. But in this caſe, <hi>jus meriti</hi> is left, and we flie to <hi>jus beneficii;</hi> we plead not merit, but mercie. And it is the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion betwixt the child &amp; GOD, and not the father and GOD: it muſt be <hi>gratuitum,</hi> his free Covenant that we muſt hold by. Therfore,
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:48000:152"/>we muſt remove from the the Court of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> to the Court of <hi>Mercie:</hi> where we have, not <hi>jus meriti,</hi> but <hi>jus beneficii:</hi> By the which as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, good fathers have wicked children, <hi>ne virtus videretur eſſe haereditaria,</hi> leaſt virtue ſhould ſeeme here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary. And againe, wicked fathers have good children, <hi>ne mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia ſerperet in infinitum,</hi> leaſt naughtineſſe ſhould grow on to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite.</p>
                        <p>To reſolve theſe; Firſt it is certaine, here is no puniſhment for the grapes that are in the fathers mouthes, but in their owne.</p>

                           <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He <hi>object</hi> of this commandement is <hi>the Name of god,</hi> or his glory. The thing commanded, is a <hi>reverent taking of his Name,</hi> comprehended in this word <hi>praiſe.</hi> And the proper place of Gods glory is in this commandement, by reaſon of the <hi>object,</hi> which is his <hi>name,</hi> by the which he is glorified. And this his glory is ſuch, as for it, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 43.7. he created all things: <hi>For mine owne glory I created them;</hi> and for this, that which was before his Creation, his <hi>predeſtination, Epheſ.</hi> 1.6. unto which wee muſt joyne our praiſe. Now if they muſt be made like to their creator; if the <hi>worke</hi> muſt be according to the minde of the <hi>maker,</hi> it is well; therefore, that end which moved him to make us, muſt be our end; and therefore all our actions and thoughts muſt come to this, to be as it is, 2. <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>That the name of our Lord Jeſus Christ may be glorified in you.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In the ſecond Commandement be theſe two <hi>reſpects,</hi> Firſt, that the honour exhibited in <hi>outward behaviour,</hi> is exhibited to one that is <hi>preſent;</hi> Secondly, that the honour exhibited is given to the party himſelfe, for to him alone it muſt be done. Now the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Tongue, which wee call Praiſe, goeth beyond theſe, and is moſt excellent; for it is of him that is abſent, and to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and not to himſelfe. Though God be preſent every where, yet when wee in our actions and ſpeeches ſpeake of him to others, there is praiſe; and ſo it goeth to him. And yet there commeth a further portion of glory. So that it is not only true, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.8. that honour is given to the perſon, but alſo to his Name, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29.2. <hi>Give to God the glory due unto his name,</hi> which giving of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is properly called praiſe: for the worſhip of God is made an eſpeciall glorification of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt, <hi>he that offereth me praiſe, glorifieth mee;</hi> which ſheweth that it is allone, to give glory to God, and to give him praiſe.</p>
                        <p>Now this praiſe hath his proper place in our mouth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.1. <hi>With my mouth will I praiſe thee,</hi> the inſtrument chiefe in this
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:48000:154"/>office, is the Tongue, and by performance of this, our tongues are made glorious: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.30. <hi>The mouth of the righteous will be talking of wiſdome, and his tongue will ſpeake of judgment.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The manner how this prayſing is to be performed is ſet downe in <hi>Moſes, Deut.</hi> 32.3. <hi>I will publiſh with my mouth, give yee glory to God, (i. e.)</hi> one muſt report, and they that heare, muſt give glory to God. Now, as was ſaid before, in the word Glory, according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it is taken both in divinity, and out of divinity; there is more, then either in honour, praiſe, or worſhip, becauſe all theſe are directed, that the party on whom they are beſtowed, might be glorified. And the matter of glory hath proportion to <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas,</hi> the brightneſſe in glaſſe, and in other ſuch viſible things; that as they are ſeene a farre off, ſo that party to whom ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is given, it is in ſuch ſort, that he might have a name a farre off, and knowne. Therefore for this cauſe in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.2. the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet having exhorted men to praiſe, he goeth further, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth them to make his praiſe glorious, that is, doing as he ſheweth us in the booke of Prayſes, that is, the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.8. Firſt by filling our owne mouths with it, and then with filling other mens eares; as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.8. <hi>O praiſe our God yee people, and make the voyce ef his praiſe to be heard.</hi> And this is to be done, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.1. <hi>continually:</hi> and ſo continually, as that there be no ſtaying, but ever more and more: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.14.15. <hi>But I will waite continually and will praiſe thee more and more. My ſoule ſhall dayly rehearſe thy righteouſneſſe and thy ſalvation: for I know no end thereof.</hi> In the duty of praiſe, touching this point of it, that when wee have reſolved our ſelves thus to fill our mouthes with it, it muſt be as it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.16. before them that feare him: and not before them alone, birds of our owne feather, but alſo before the Congregation, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.1. <hi>Let his praiſe be heard in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the Saints:</hi> and not only before <hi>every aſsembly,</hi> but before the <hi>great aſſembly,</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>I have declared thy righteouſneſſe in the great Congregation.</hi> Gather all into one place, and one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly: yet this is his wiſh, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.18. that he might fill all the World with his praiſe: and that he might ſpeake to a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of all Nations: <hi>Forſake mee not untill I have declared thine arme to this generation, and thy power to all them that ſhall come.</hi> And that that goeth beyond all this, that he is not content with this, but is deſirous to deliver over this affection ſo, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.31. and 72.17. it ſhould continue ſo long as the world endureth. So much of the end of this Commandement.</p>

                        <p n="2">2. They gather the neceſſity of the end out of the word Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:48000:155"/>by <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. It may be better gathered out of the words following. The firſt thing that he did after his Creation, was the ſanctifying of a day to that end, to be wholly ſpent in his praiſe. In which reſpect of favour Chriſt delivering to us a forme of Prayer; though God in the firſt place (commanded,) that the internall worſhip ſhould be firſt, yet having regard to the end, and knowing that the end in our intention is the firſt, he giveth it for the firſt petition, and teacheth that we might firſt deſire Gods name to be hallowed.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. That was ſaid before, it was the worke of the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and that is a figure and reſemblance of all the actions wee ſhall be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied about <hi>in patriâ,</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi>) in Heaven. This is a third thing that commendeth it unto us, that it ſhall be our continuall, <hi>opus,</hi> in our Countrey, and therefore if any be deſirous to participate the Celeſtiall exerciſes here, let him ſpend his time in glorifying God while he is here.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The ſetting of us while wee are here in earth, being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what lower then the Angells in their eſtate. Their delight is, as <hi>Luk.</hi> 1. to ſing <hi>Hallelujah, praiſe to the Lord.</hi> It is the exaltation of the nature of man, while he is yet in the way of corruption, and while he is on earth, to be made equall to the Angells in this worke of praiſe.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. The caſting downe of a man, when he is not fit to do it, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148. ſaith, that ſeing the baſeſt of them are called to doe it; then he is baſer then the vileſt creatures, that will not doe it.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. From the exerciſe of the Church militant, it is beſt acceptable to him, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. <hi>verſ. ult.</hi> it is the worke of the Temple, and ſo conſequently, to be preferred before the work of the Market place: The reaſon of the place, as that place is the place of all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
                        <p n="7">7. This is alone the thing that diſtinguiſheth a man from all other creatures; all other creatures have but one ſound, they have no voyce. And as he is a <hi>Reaſonable ſoule,</hi> he is diſtinguiſhed in regard of the firſt commandement, ſo his voyce, in regard of this commandement, man alone hath a diſtinct voyce, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can praiſe God with the tongue, and therefore ought to be delighted in that, wherein he excelleth all other Creatures, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) with the glorifying of the name of God.</p>
                        <p n="8">8. Not onely becauſe it is a proper worke of Man, but that which is next, that by this meanes, whatſoever is occupied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, whether it be tongue, lippe, or penne, &amp;c. it getteth a dignity by it. And as <hi>James</hi> 5.8. caſteth downe the tongue when it is lewdly occupied; ſo <hi>David</hi> extolleth it when it is thus occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied. It is in the higheſt degree of dignity.</p>
                        <p n="9">9. For the reverence of the great commendations and motives that this yeelding of praiſes hath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.1. It is not only good and honeſt, but alſo pleaſant. <hi>Davids</hi> ſoule, at the praiſe of God, was as delightfull, as his mouth filled with marrow, and that it is
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:48000:155"/>ſeemly and profitable, <hi>honoriſicantes me honorificabo,</hi> they that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour me I will honour; God will beſtow what he can upon him; and for the reward, it is to be choſen.</p>
                        <p n="10">10. Whereas the excellency of man ſtandeth rather in <hi>dare</hi> then <hi>accipere,</hi> in giving rather then in receiving; and rather in <hi>facere quàm in fieri,</hi> in doing rather then ſuffering; here is only our <hi>facere &amp; dare.</hi> In all other things wee are made, and wee receive: but this wee give: glorify to God, magnifie him, ſanctify him. There is as it were magnifying, and as it were an holineſſe wrought in him by our praiſe.</p>
                        <p n="11">11. This duty lyeth ſo ſtraite on us, as that though Chriſt commands the contrary, (as in the man delivered from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill,) yet he muſt not be obeyed: whereas all other precepts are ſuch, as the contrary of that commandement, is not to be done; there is no ſuch thing here: there can be no precept againſt this precept.</p>

                        <p>Now this very Name is reverently to be uſed; Of every of theſe names may it be ſaid, as the Angell ſaid to <hi>Manoah, Jud.</hi> 13.18. that it is moſt fearfull; And if the Angell, <hi>Jud.</hi> 13.18. appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to <hi>Manoah,</hi> ſayd to him inquiring after his Name, <hi>Search not after my name for it is fearefull:</hi> much more is the name of the Lord <hi>fearefull,</hi> and cannot be knowne. It is no queſtion, as it is <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.58. ſo it is. If thou wilt not doe all theſe words that are written in this booke, if thou wilt not beare reverence to this name, <hi>The Lord thy God,</hi> then there followeth a Catalogue of Plagues in that place.</p>
                        <p>Now if that be reverenced, then the ſecond uſe of his name is much more to be reverenced, becauſe men are onely knowne or diſtinguiſhed by it, that ſome duty might ſome way be done to them, that is not done to any other. We muſt take heed of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees diſtinction, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.33. concerning this name; that except he did ſweare by the <hi>Lord Jehova,</hi> and take the very Name of God in his mouth, he was ſafe from this commandement, but there a man might ſweare by the <hi>Heavens,</hi> or <hi>Earth,</hi> or <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe they were not the Name of God, therefore that that maketh this Name, is that wee call a <hi>Good name</hi> in Engliſh, or <hi>Credit</hi> in private men: but thoſe that are in higher places, as the dialect of Princes is, their glory, magnificence, majeſtie, &amp;c. as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.11. <hi>that they might have a name, and praiſe, and glory.</hi> For the name <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, of <hi>praiſe</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and the common phraſe of that tongue is this, that if a man be in credit, he is called, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> 
                           <hi>a man of Name,</hi> a man of credit, a famous perſon. This good name hath a more extra or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary commendation annexed to it; according to the glory of the perſon, ſo riſeth this name: as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.4. that Chriſt was ſo much above the Angells in glory, as he had received a more excellent Name then they, and <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.5. it is the practiſe of God; when he would exalt <hi>Abraham</hi> from an Harlot to his Church, and eſtabliſh the church in his houſe, and make him Father of the faithfull; then becauſe he was more glorious, he giveth him a more glorious name: <hi>Thou ſhalt no more bee called</hi> Abram, <hi>but</hi> Abraham, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And wee ſee the like, <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.10. <hi>Jacobs</hi> name is changed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> a name of more dignity.</p>
                        <p>Then the ſecond uſe is of <hi>good report,</hi> if it be of private men: For a private man, it is a pleaſure to have a good name, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. <hi>A good name is better then a good oyntment.</hi> The eſpeciall thing to keep a mans name; becauſe it was it, that was moſt uſuall and moſt eſteemed in thoſe dayes; and for treaſure and profit; <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.1. <hi>A mans name is better then either ſilver or gold:</hi> The other
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:48000:156"/>name may be changed, as <hi>Abrahams</hi> and <hi>Jacobs:</hi> but this is ſuch as may not be forgon for neither pleaſure nor profit. And it is not onely of Gods Law, but alſo of mans: the Heathen could ſee the excellency of this; for they ſay, <hi>Intereſſe famae eſt majus omni alio intereſſe,</hi> the weight of a mans good report goeth beyond and above all weight: And further as a Father ſaith, <hi>Fama pari paſſu cum vita ambulat,</hi> goeth cheek by joll with his life: Man ſeeth this, that it is greatly to be magnified; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 138.2. <hi>Thou haſt magnified thy name above all things by thy word.</hi> So that indeed it is the glory of God that is chiefly here intended, and ſecondly his very name.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. <hi>Non aſſumis, &amp;c.</hi> thou ſhalt not take. To underſtand it ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; it is the ſcarcity of our tongue,<note place="margin">Take.</note> that the word is no better expreſſed: For the word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap> from whence it commeth, hath a double uſe; and to theſe two, may be referred whatſoever is bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed. It ſignifieth properly to <hi>take up, to lift up;</hi> and that two ſorts of things; Firſt, it is applyed to a <hi>ſtandard</hi> or <hi>banner;</hi> and ſecondly, to an heavy thing, as a <hi>burthen:</hi> And indeed, theſe two kindes of things are they, that wee take away or remove. If any thing be glorious, we are content commonly to take and lift it up: And on the other ſide, if there be any thing that is neceſſary, and that we have uſe of, though it be heavy and weighty, yet we will lift it; ſo that the one is <hi>in rebus glorioſis,</hi> the other, <hi>in rebus neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riis.</hi> On the contrary, if they be neither glorious nor neceſſary we let them lye; the firſt uſe, the glory of it is ſet downe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 28.37. God ſaith there muſt be a Plate, and in it muſt be written, <hi>SANCTITAS JEHOVAE,</hi> Holineſſe to the LORD: and it muſt be removed to <hi>Aarons</hi> forehead, as it muſt ſtand in the Myter of <hi>Aaron.</hi> And <hi>Moſes,</hi> in <hi>Exo.</hi> 17.15. called the Altar, <hi>Jehovah niſsi!</hi> from a word of great affinity, <hi>The Lord isour ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard;</hi> that is lifted up as glorious things: as the badge of any Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, it is lifted up on the ſhoulders of their ſervants to be ſeen.</p>
                        <p>For the other uſe, for lifting up of a weighty thing, for the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and uſe; <hi>Gen.</hi> 29.7, 8. of the great ſtone before the Well, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> did not lift it up, till all the ſheepe came together, till there was great need. The firſt of theſe pertaineth properly to all the reſt of the duties of prayſing, to all that take Gods name: The ſecond onely to the duty of Swearing; for that is an heavy thing. Under theſe two, are comprehended all other takings of his name whatſoever. But to take them as they are under the firſt; namely, in lifting it up as a thing glorious; as the Standard of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Plate of <hi>Aaron:</hi> the firſt thing enjoyned is this, The being called by his name, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.16. as a great dignity and priviledge, <hi>Jacob</hi> granted to <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> but denyed it to the reſt; and it is part of the glory that children take of their Parents, their name: So we are called Gods children, by his name; and not that alone, but <hi>Eſay</hi> 4.1. Seven women come to one man, and ſay, We will eate of our owne bread, and weare our owne gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, onely let us be called by thy Name, to put our ſhame from
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:48000:157"/>us. And in marriage the woman honoureth the Husband by lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving her owne name, and taking his; and it is a glory to her, that ſhe may ſo doe. In the truth of this it is ſaid, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.7. <hi>They ſhall be called by my name, for I have created and formed them, &amp;c.</hi> How is that? That is no otherwiſe, then as it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26. the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples at <hi>Antioch</hi> were firſt called Chriſtians; for that is the moſt excellent name that is. That glory that becommeth Chriſt is given to Chriſt.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond is, that the ſervant by lifting up on his ſhoulder his Maſters Badge or armes, lifteth up his countenance, but with ſervice; that is, to his Maſters glory there is joyned a ſervice of his: and therefore to his glory, all his doings from that time forth, muſt be referred: and ſo we muſt be at Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to doe his buſineſſe, having his Badge; which is plaine, by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. God can receive no profit, but glory; therefore, to his glory we muſt referre all that we doe. For if you once come to that, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.4. <hi>Paremus nobis nomen, I will get my ſelfe a name.</hi> Then we ſee it is accounted <hi>Bellare cum Deo,</hi> to wage warre with God; and he will viſit them with the confuſion of tongues and mindes: not onely that, but if a man doe not referre, but take glory to himſelfe; as 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.8. of <hi>Abſalom. Thy ſervant vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c. If the Lord ſhall bring me indeed to Ieruſalem, I will ſerve the Lord,</hi> and 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.9. of <hi>Iezabels</hi> faſt; the one ſetting the name of God on a bloody murther; the other, the vow upon a wicked and lewd conſpiracy. To abuſe the name of God to our owne wicked inventions, is a monſtrous thing.</p>
                        <p>Theſe are within us, now without us.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. In our tongue. The 1. thing is, as <hi>Gen.</hi> 29. <hi>verſ.</hi> laſt: of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> of whom were the Jewes, he was called <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> becauſe his mother ſaid, ſhe would confeſſe Gods name. To God we are not <hi>Iehudim</hi> if we take to our ſelves a name: but we muſt weare our name to Gods glory, and not be aſhamed: but when we are aſhamed of it, we care not for it, we confeſſe it not, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.32. the duty is plaine, Will ye confeſſe me before men? I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe you before my Father: Are ye aſhamed of me before men? I will be aſhamed of you before my Father. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.8. When there come many evill workes, yet this weigheth them all, that they had not denyed his name: as on the contrary, <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.9. When a man commeth to receive and weare the marke of the Beaſt, and his name; then a portion is given him in the Lake that burneth with fire and brimſtone.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond, of the outward, may be comprehended under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing, and it is called <hi>defending,</hi> when we heare it blaſphemed: God ſaith, <hi>Eſay</hi> 59.16. his truth went downe into the judgement ſeat, and through the ſtreets, in every place, and none would open his mouth to defend and ſpeake well of it: and therefore, when he ſaw none would doe it, he will make his owne armes to ſerve; and therefore we ſee how terrible and fearefull a judgement hee threatneth them in the end of the chapter.</p>
                        <pb n="301" facs="tcp:48000:157"/>
                        <p n="3">3. That that is contrary in his part, is the doing as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Sadduces</hi> doe; they come to Chriſt and ſay, Thou art a good man, how ſayſt thou, is it reaſon to pay tribute to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or no? Some ſay, for diſputations ſake it is lawfull for them to defend wicked opinions and aſſertions in Religion. This may be done in neceſſity. Now out of the caſe of neceſſity, a man is bound, as <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>to make mention of his name;</hi> that is, to uſe it, in his ſpeech, to ſhew himſelfe mindfull of him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 50.3. becauſe of the great mourning the Aegyptians made for <hi>Jacobs</hi> death; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in recompence, the Inhabitants called the name of the place of his buriall, a place of mourning. Though it be ſaid, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Take heed ye forget not.</hi> Forget, ſaith <hi>Jerome,</hi> it is impoſſible they ſhould; but he telleth how; If you forget me, and behave your ſelves ſo in your ſpeeehes, as that there is no man but would thinke you have forgotten him. When a man ſhall live ſo, that nothing concerning the praiſe of God cometh into his mouth in ſeven yeares. It is the fault of many: And though they ſay they have not forgotten, yet there can be nothing gathered, but that they have: and ſo, <hi>rarum erat nomen Jehovae,</hi> a reverend mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the name of God was rare in ſome mens mouths: <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.31. it is ſaid, that the juſt mans mouth, doth <hi>meditari ſapientiam,</hi> meditate wiſedome; that is, ſpeake of ſomething that may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to Gods glory; and <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.11. <hi>&amp;</hi> 12.18. he calleth the tongue of a wiſe man, <hi>venam vitae &amp; ipſam ſalutem,</hi> a veine of life, and health it ſelfe; out of which there may returne glory to God, and health to himſelfe. But of a fooles mouth, he ſaith, <hi>Pro.</hi> 15.2. it doth <hi>ebullire,</hi> it bableth and foameth out vanity and fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: The word he uſeth is <hi>vanity,</hi> that is, there is no good nor profitable uſe of it. So that <hi>mentio,</hi> and not onely that, but <hi>hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifica mentio,</hi> an honourable mention; out of the caſe of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, muſt ſerve the turne: for a man to ſpeake of the name of God, as God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 9.16. he will therefore ſhew his judgements upon <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> becauſe he will have men ſpeake of him through the World. That is the firſt, it ſhall be <hi>ſylva orationis.</hi>

                        <p>Contrary to this, when a man receiveth mercy, and it is not great enough, he grudgeth, and is not thankefull for it; and a judgement, and it is too great; and then commonly he murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and every thing he converteth to the diſpraiſe of God: he learneth not to bleſſe God, whether he give or take away; as <hi>Iob</hi> did.</p>

                        <p>There follow two for our <hi>outward</hi> actions, making them glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious: that is, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. that we deale ſo in our actions, that they may ſee our good workes and glorifie our heavenly Father; that is, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>Every man that taketh the name of Ieſus in his mouth, let him depart from iniquitie:</hi> for the wickedneſſe of the Child polluteth the Father; <hi>Levit.</hi> 21.9. If the daughter of a Prieſt commit fornication, ſhe polluteth her Father: So do the wicked the name of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. he is our Father, when we take his name upon us, and doe not glorifie him as we ſhould, nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from iniquitie; we doe what we can to make him polluted.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:48000:158"/>There are many careleſſe and notorious men; and yet <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50. they will take the covenant of God in their mouthes, and talke of points of Religion. This muſt not be done, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. to wound Gods name by our evill converſation, and cauſe others to ſinne.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond in this point, is the commandement of a <hi>Free Vow, Pſal.</hi> 119.108. <hi>Lord I beſeech thee accept the free offerings of my mouth, and teach me thy judgements;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 76.11. that a man ſhould make a freewill offering to God; inſomuch as God hath done ſo many things for us, we ſhould not onely doe the things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of God, but <hi>vow</hi> our ſelves.</p>
                        <p>Now as touching the uſe or neceſſity of Gods name in an <hi>Oath,</hi> the commandement is, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord, and ſweare by his name;</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 10.20. Thou ſhalt feare, ſerve, and cleave to God, and ſweare by his name.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>Theſe three being marked, we ſhall ſoon know what it is to take Gods name in <hi>vaine.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Firſt, we know, in the chiefe ſignification, that which wanteth an end, and is done to no end, is ſaid to be in vaine: as <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.16. <hi>You ſhall ſow your ſeed in Vaine:</hi> you ſow your ſeed to get a harveſt; and you hope for it: You ſhall have no harveſt, your e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhall eate it up. So it is of Gods name; he that for no end lifteth up Gods name, doth it in Vaine: Therefore wee muſt looke <hi>cui bono?</hi> what fruit have ye of it? the fruit and profit, is our end: So if we doe no good, it is done in vaine, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.7. All other faire ſhewes, are like ſtreight and well faſhioned leggs, which yet cannot goe. <hi>Fruſtra pulchras habet tibias claudus;</hi> if it be not the due end. Now the great and chiefe end is the glory of God; it is that that he requireth; he would impart all the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe he hath upon us; and requireth nothing againe of us, but glory. To which if we bring no profit, we muſt be accounted of him, as <hi>Nabal</hi> was to <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.21. <hi>David</hi> had done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>good turnes for <hi>Nabals</hi> ſhepheards, he deſired nothing but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle meate, and could not have it: Therefore he ſaid, <hi>All that I have done for him is in vaine.</hi> So it is in the caſe of Gods glory; God doth all for his owne glory: ſo if that come not by us, then all that he hath done is in vaine.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, under this greate end, is next, the health of our ſelves, and our brethren, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.16. he ſaith, he hath laboured in vaine; ſo if there be not ſought things tending to Gods glory, to our neighbours edifying, and our owne ſoules health, it is in vaine, and to no end. The firſt, <hi>Vaine is ex privatione finis,</hi> when it wanteth an End.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Yet if there be an end, we muſt looke to the Agent, that is,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:48000:159"/>the ſwearer, the perſon; conſequently upon that part in him, that is the principall agent; that is, his ſoule and heart: For if his ſoule be <gap reason="foreign">

                           <hi>Rhachah,</hi> that is, a <hi>vaine</hi> ſoule, it commeth not with due adviſement and reverence: as <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. if it be <hi>Actio erroris,</hi> an action of errour; that is ſet againſt conſtancy, though he have a good end, yet if he doe not ſo ſtably as is ſaid, it is in vaine; that is, lightneſſe: if any come to take the name of God, and if he be not <hi>res ſtabilis,</hi> and he come not with due reverence; there is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther taking in vaine: When it is <gap reason="foreign">

                           <note place="margin">3. Worke.</note> in that there is a third vanity, when a thing beareth a ſhew of that it is not this, <hi>vanitas opponitur veritati,</hi> this vanity is oppoſed to vertiy; want of ſtability, want of truth. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.15. It is a <hi>vaine</hi> thing, a thing of <hi>errour, (i. e.)</hi> when the thing is taken from a <hi>Lie,</hi> for looke what truth is in naturall things, the ſame is truth in morall things. If it want his <hi>juſtice</hi> in <hi>action,</hi> it is vaine; if it want his truth in <hi>affection,</hi> it is vaine.</p>
                        <p>Of the two <hi>manners,</hi> whereby the name of God is lifted up by us, the one was as a <hi>burthen,</hi> which is applied to the neceſſary uſe of it; and being neceſſary, it commeth firſt to be intreated off and handled, I meane that taking of Gods name up by ſwearing by it; wherein albeit God be not more, nor ſo much glorified, as in the other kind, yet in regard of our neceſſary uſe of it, the precept hath almoſt taken up the whole commandement, as little mention of it.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>duty.</hi> As firſt for the neceſſity of it, upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, after this manner it is expedient that all controverſies, (<hi>Heb.</hi> 6.16.) and ſtrifes ſhould not be continued, but have an end; and this cannot be, except one part have a confirmation above the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And for confirmation of theſe, wee ſee God, <hi>Gen</hi> 18.21. when he in his judgment will goe downe, <hi>ut certò cognoſcat,</hi> to know it ſurely; that he may proceed on a ſure ground. Now this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding where it may be had by <hi>argument</hi> or <hi>proofe,</hi> it is beſt: So, if it can be, as wee ſee the practiſe of <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his <hi>brethren, Gen.</hi> 42.20. this was his triall of their truth, if they brought <hi>Benjamin.</hi> Where <hi>Argument</hi> and <hi>reaſon</hi> wanteth, there wee muſt come to <hi>witneſſes,</hi> which is the ſecond courſe, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.15. where argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or proofe wanteth, that the matter ſhould be eſtabliſhed in the mouth of two or three witneſſes. And becauſe many times it falleth out, that not only proofe, but alſo <hi>witneſses</hi> want; then, as <hi>Numb.</hi> 5.13. the man being in jealouſy upon a ſuſpition of his wifes adultery, the woman not being taken in the very deed, then as it is <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. ſhee ſhall ſweare that ſhee hath not defiled her ſelfe. This neceſſity, as many times in regard of the action, it is <hi>hidden:</hi> ſo alwaies in theſe two reſpects it falleth out that when there is an aſſurance to be had, <hi>de occultis cordium,</hi> of the hidden ſecrets of the heart, which cannot be knowne by any externall
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:48000:159"/>proofe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>who knoweth the heart?</hi> there is no knowledge of it. And ſecondly, when it is concerning things to <hi>come, Eccl.</hi> 8.7. <hi>who knoweth that which is to come?</hi> then commeth an <hi>Oath</hi> to men: they cannot be wiſe, becauſe they cannot know what will come hereafter; ſo for promiſes: of theſe three cannot be by witneſſe and argument any <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>or confirmation had.</hi> Now in regard of the ſecrets of a mans heart, and of uncertaintyes in things to come, here commeth in the <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>Oaths.</hi> Of <hi>ſecret</hi> things, ſome are <hi>de facto,</hi> paſt, here is <hi>jus jurandum aſſertorium,</hi> an oath of aſſertion; ſome are to <hi>come,</hi> and there <hi>jus jurandum promiſſorium,</hi> an oath of promiſe. Then when as the argument of a mans will, and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of his mouth falleth out, in theſe caſes there is no way but to fly to God, <hi>(i.e.)</hi> to make him a <hi>witneſſe;</hi> and not only a <hi>witneſſe,</hi> but a <hi>Judge</hi> and a <hi>revenger,</hi> if he be called to an <hi>untruth,</hi> for it is nothing els, but calling him to witneſſe.</p>
                        <p>In this place falleth the two parts of an oath according to theſe two, Firſt, where God is called as a <hi>witneſſe,</hi> whether it be <hi>true;</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, the other where it is called forth as a <hi>Revenger,</hi> if it be <hi>falſe.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt is called <hi>ſub Deo teſte: Conteſtatio;</hi> a taking to witneſſe; ſo did God himſelfe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.21. <hi>vivo ego,</hi> as truly as I live; ſo the Fathers in the old Teſtament began to uſe it, <hi>Judg.</hi> 8.10. <hi>vivit Jehovah,</hi> as the Lord liveth; and ſo I ſhall ſee the effect of that I promiſe.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond part, <hi>Sub deo vindice,</hi> this is called <hi>Execratio,</hi> that is, the <hi>curſe of themſelves,</hi> if it be not true, as he may well witneſſe to it. And againe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 28. he taketh this order; but this alſo in relation to that place: where are all the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his revenge, <hi>Sic faciat mihi Dominus, &amp; addat,</hi> the Lord doe ſo to me and more alſo, if that they have not ſpoken the truth. The firſt plague and the ſecond, it commeth in thoſe termes, <hi>God doe this to me,</hi> and add this alſo. So it is uſed by <hi>Ely,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>God doe ſo to thee, and more:</hi> And when he is brought to this, that he hath affirmed it, and God is his witneſſe, and if God be called to an untruth, that he hath deſired againſt his ſoule: then (as in Greek) it is called <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, <hi>an end of contention.</hi> And ſo of the neceſſity of an oath, and upon what cauſes oathes were firſt: But our neceſſity is ſmall, except
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:48000:160"/>God have glory by it. Then to apply this to the ſcope of Gods glory; there commeth a great portion of glory to God in an Oath: For firſt our rules of reaſon tell us, that <hi>Nihil confirmatur niſi per certius,</hi> there is no confirmation but by a thing more ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. Then there is a great honour to God, when Demonſtration and all faile, that his name ſhould be <hi>Turris fortiſsima,</hi> the moſt ſtrong tower; more certaine then all reaſons and witneſſes, &amp;c. ſo that we count it as <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. <hi>The name of the Lord is a ſtrong tower, the righteous runneth to it, and is exalted.</hi> (And the Heathen man ſaith, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>of all things men ſet moſt by their faith</hi>) When all faile, we may take Sanctuary here: This is the firſt part of the honour of God.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In regard of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> as before, his greateſt <hi>honour,</hi> the ground of all honours, Faith; that this proceedeth from a great Faith. In regard of the former part of an oath, that is, <hi>Conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> that we beare witneſſe with tongue that are preſent: that we beleeve as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5. that God will lighten all things that are in darkneſſe, that God will make all manifeſt: He ſeeth all things, even the very ſecrets of the heart. And ſecondly in regard of the <hi>execution:</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.19. that he will puniſh: <hi>mihi ultio &amp; ego retribuam,</hi> Vengeance is mine and I will repay it: Herein we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that God hath power to bring his judgements upon us. This beleife, that he hath vengeance to execute, turneth greatly to Gods glory; and therefore was it, that God was contented as it were to lend his name to ſweare by it, to make an end of their queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus we ſee how God hath his glory hence.</p>
                        <p>The next thing is to ſee what we are <hi>commanded</hi> and <hi>forbidden.</hi>
                        </p>

So we ſee what Gods will is herein, what he commandeth; and then the great end of Gods glory, and neceſſity of men.</p>

                        <p>And as theſe come under the forme of a Publique oath; ſo for Private oathes in the New Teſtament, in remembrance, in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and in love. <hi>Paul</hi> ſeareth not in <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.9. and <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.8. to call God to witneſſe for a matter of ſuſpition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Now I call God to record unto my ſoule, &amp;c.</hi> all this tendeth to this end, that we ſeeing the two maine reaſons; the exact Commandement of God: his owne example, and the Fathers in the Old Teſtament, and the Apoſtles in the New: We might be farre from the vaine opinion of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> that are gain ſayers of this firſt part, and hold that we may not ſweare at all; grounding on Chriſts words, <hi>Sweare not at all.</hi> For <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. wee know that Chriſt
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:48000:161"/>came not to breake the Law, nor to undoe the leaſt jot of the Law; and if it had beene his meaning to have had us not to ſweare at all, he would have ſaid, <hi>Non aſſumes nomen Dei omnino,</hi> thou ſhalt not take the name of the Lord thy God at all: For Chriſts words, <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>they ſhould not ſweare at all:</hi> Sure it is, that you muſt marke the ſcope; for it muſt bee referred to the ſcope of the place: which is to reconcile the Law from the <hi>Phariſees</hi> corrupt interpretation; for they thought if any man ſwore by any other name, ſo that he ſware not by the name of <hi>Iehovah, ſumere nomen Iehovae,</hi> and onely <hi>fruſtra,</hi> in vaine; that hee might ſweare by any other name. Some take alſo <hi>jurare</hi> to be put for <hi>pejurare. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> in his 27. Homilie, and 30. <hi>de verbis Apoſtoli,</hi> handleth it ſufficiently and largely.</p>
                        <p>To ſweare is commanded, and to conſent to <hi>Anabaptiſme</hi> is forbidden.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond point <hi>Affirmative,</hi> the word added here, Thou ſhalt take the name of God: that is, our ſwearing muſt be by the name of God, and by no other, <hi>Eſay</hi> 48.1. There are they that will ſweare by the name of the Lord, but not in truth and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. They that ſweare not by his name, take away his praero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; <hi>I have ſworne that every tongue ſhould ſweare by me.</hi> This is his <hi>Prerogative royall;</hi> this it one of his priviledges: therefore it is often called, <hi>the Oath of the Lord, Iusjurandum Iehovae;</hi> So <hi>dignari alios honore hoc,</hi> or to tranſlate the praerogative of God from him, that is the thing that is forbidden: and that is two wayes.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, if we leave out the name of God, and in ſtead of it take another, as <hi>Amos</hi> 8.14. they had forgotten God, and ſwore by the Sin of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Thy God O Dan liveth, &amp;c.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, when we can be content to name him, but ſo, as to add another name to it, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Vivit Iehovah, &amp; vivit Malcham,</hi> that ſweare by Jehovah, and that ſweare by Malcham; this joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether it be falſe god, or any creature: they are both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull and forbidden. The firſt, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.13. <hi>You ſhall not make mention of the name of other gods;</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> 23.7. the very ſame is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4. <hi>But they that runne after another god, ſhall have great trouble; their drinke and blood offerings will I not offer, neither make mention of their names within my lipps. Hoſea</hi> 2.17. <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the name of</hi> Baalim <hi>out of their mouth,</hi> they ſhall forget him. <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.2. and <hi>Ier.</hi> 5.7. If any ſweare by that that is no god, it is an <hi>abhomination.</hi> For in this there is a three fold <hi>injury:</hi> Firſt, to <hi>God,</hi> that requireth his glory to be done to himſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, to <hi>our ſelves, Hebr.</hi> 6.16. hee that ſweareth, muſt ſweare by a greater: And therefore he ſetteth it above himſelfe; and if he ſweare by a creature, hee maketh it greater then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, and to the <hi>Creature</hi> it ſelfe, which is contented with his owne place: So by the Law, which God hath ſet in it, and would be avenged of us.</p>
                        <pb n="309" facs="tcp:48000:161"/>
                        <p>This is the ſecond, when any Idoll or creature hath beene abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as by this Bread, we confirme our controverſies.</p>
                        <p>The third is <hi>in vanum,</hi> in vaine: And that that is oppoſite to it, is commonly in ſwearing, taken out of <hi>Jerome, Hom. in Jer.</hi> 4.2. for he ſpeaking there of a people that ſhould ſweare aright, he ſaith, they ſhould ſweare, <hi>in veritate, judicio, &amp; in juſticia,</hi> in truth, in judgement, and in righteouſneſſe. Theſe are ſaith <hi>Jerome</hi> 3. <hi>comites juramenti,</hi> the three comitants of an oath: If we have not theſe, the other may be refuſed.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, for truth: Wee have a commandement, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.12. that is oppoſed againſt <hi>perjury.</hi> To call God to witneſſe to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme falſhood. <hi>Auguſtine, Vt hic eſt deteſtanda bellua!</hi> Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver doth this, ſeemeth to bee a man, and becommeth a beaſt that thinketh ſo. The Heathen and the Jewes, as ſaith <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Perjurii paena, capite plectatur,</hi> Doth he call God to witneſſe to an untruth? Let him loſe his head.</p>
                        <p>This is done; Firſt if a man doe teſtifie falſhood: Secondly, or if it be of that he doubteth of.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, <hi>Falſe,</hi> either when we know it to be falſe. 2. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it is true: but <hi>falſum; commentitium, putativè,</hi> when a man will affirme it will fall out otherwiſe; he is guilty. And this in <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertorio Iuramento,</hi> in an oath of aſſertion: When any of theſe is done, there is <hi>Perjury.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>In Promiſſorio,</hi> in an oath of promiſe; when there is not <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum propoſitum,</hi> we doe not purpoſe, <hi>ſi non ſtatuat, aut ſi non perſtet,</hi> either not to purpoſe then, or not to purpoſe when it ſhould bee performed.</p>
                        <p>Examples of it, <hi>Mar.</hi> 14.71. for affirming of falſhood, <hi>Iura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum Petri, Peters</hi> oath; a fearefull thing, it coſt many teares. For the other, not performing, <hi>in Promiſſorio,</hi> under an oath of promiſe; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.2. There was an oath made, and by covenant, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.15. <hi>So</hi> Joſhva <hi>made peace and league with them, that hee would ſuffer them to live; alſo the Princes of the congregation ſwore unto them.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Secondly, for <hi>juſtice;</hi> that holdeth either altogether, or for the moſt part <hi>in Iuramento promiſsorio</hi> onely, in an oath of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; truth holds in both, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.2. that is, when a man ſweareth to that which is poſſible and honeſt; it is a juſt oath, elſe it is unjuſt. If it be <hi>inhoneſtum,</hi> diſhoneſt; then it is not <hi>Ius,</hi> in juſtice; if impoſſible, then it is not <hi>Iurandum,</hi> an oath to bee ſworne: Examples, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.10. <hi>Saul</hi> tooke counſell at the Witch, lent her an oath, which was inhoneſt and unlawfull. Impoſſible was the oath of them, <hi>Acts</hi> 23.4. that ſwore they would neither eate nor drinke, till they had killed <hi>Paul.</hi> After a man hath taken ſuch an oath, there doth, <hi>emergere aliquid impoſsibile,</hi> ſome impoſſibility ariſe. This impoſſible it may be, <hi>è principio,</hi> a thing that alwayes was impoſſible; or ſecondly, <hi>emergens poſt Iuramentum,</hi> or an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility emergent after the oath. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> on the oath that <hi>Herod</hi> tooke, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.23. ſaith, That of it ſelfe it was not unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:48000:162"/>nor evill, and might have been performed if a thing poſſible and lawfull had been required: therefore when ſhe asked his head, it was <hi>emergens illicitum.</hi> For there is no oath of promiſe, but it doth <hi>elicere,</hi> it is a drawing out; or underſtand theſe two: as <hi>Ioſeph</hi> to his Miſtreſſe, <hi>How can I doe it?</hi> that is, How can I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly doe it. <hi>In malis promiſsis neſcire fidem,</hi> unlawfull oathes are better broke then kept. The reaſon is, there is <hi>exitus ſine tertio,</hi> when the oath is paſt; he muſt chooſe whether to keepe in that ſinne, or fall into two other; Firſt, into unlawfull murther; Secondly, ſuperſtition in the fooliſh keeping of the oath; into ſuperſtition, if hee thinke it not to be broken, or murther if he doe it.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. In <hi>judicio,</hi> in Judgement, that is, as <hi>Hierome</hi> ſaith, <hi>In diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretione,</hi> in diſcretion; it ſtandeth upon this point, to know the nature of an oath to be, not <hi>bonum per ſe,</hi> a thing good of it ſelfe; but <hi>bonum neceſſarium,</hi> a good in neceſſity: and <hi>neceſſarium extra terminos neceſsitatis, non eſt neceſſarium neque bonum,</hi> a neceſſary good, but in caſe of neceſſity, is neither neceſſary nor good; as a Potion is neceſſary, but when a man needeth it. So conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in judgement, a man muſt ſo ſtand in it, that hee come to an oath neceſſarily: And that is naught, <hi>extra terminos neceſsitatis,</hi> when there is no neceſſity; as not becauſe the oftner he doth it, the better it is; but <hi>propter defectum:</hi> The caſe is made plaine by <hi>Davids</hi> doing, <hi>Mar.</hi> 2.25. when hee had need, hee fed himſelfe with the Shew-bread; which, if he had had other bread, he would not have done; neceſſity makes things good, which otherwiſe were not good to doe.</p>
                        <p>So in caſe of neceſſity a man may come to ſweare, elſe not: In a caſe of neceſſity we may come to the Sanctuary, not to fire a Beacon;<note place="margin">To take in this neceſſity, there are two things:

The difference is this, that the oath is neceſſary, the vow is a thing of our owne accord voluntarily offered. And againe, that an oath is betwixt man and man; but a vow betwixt Us and God. <hi>This vow is, when by the particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Gods graces in us, we bind our ſelves, either ſecretly in heart, or elſe outwardly in word before others, to yeeld him any duty, which by neceſsity we are not bound to doe.</hi> It may be performed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies; and they may all be reduced to two.</p>
                        <p>The limitation of ſome generall Commandement, to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; as this, To give almes, it is a generall commandement; but to reſtraine my ſelfe to this perſon, or to give this quantity of my goods, yearely, and weekly; we know it falleth not under any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept; neither is commanded ſpecially: So theſe particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints fall under the Vow.</p>

When a man can be content to abridge himſelfe of any lawfull thing, which Chriſtian liberty maketh common to all, leaſt he fall into unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full things. Or thus, When a man by the uſe of any lawfull or indifferent thing, findeth himſelfe leſſe able and leſſe meete to ſanctifie the name of God: and ſo entreth into a vow with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, to abſtaine in that behalfe. Such a Vow ſeemed that of the <hi>Rechabites. Jere.</hi> 35.6. So wee ſee howe the matter of a Vow ſtandeth either in binding of generall commandements, to a particular perſon: or in uſing or not uſing thoſe things which Chriſtian libertie maketh lawfull: according as his owne expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience ſhall find moſt profitable for him, that his courſe in godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe may be more ſwift. It is true that <hi>David,</hi> 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14.
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:48000:164"/>ſaith, <hi>quae de manu tua accepimus, ea offerimus tibi.</hi> When the people had offred willingly to the LORD, this is his Vow and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: that they <hi>gave</hi> nothing, but they had <hi>receaved</hi> it. And a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> ſaith, <hi>Dedit autem ſua Dominus, vt reciperet ſua: &amp; recipiendo ſun daret ſe:</hi> the LORD gave his owne, that hee might receave his owne againe, and receaving his owne, that hee might give himſelfe: and with himſelfe, all that hee hath: a greater gift than wee can poſſeſſe in this life.

So is it in theſe two words, <hi>vovete &amp; reddite,</hi> Vow and pay.

                        <p>Now to come to the <hi>neceſsitie</hi> of a Vow for our partes, where our hearts are to doe good, <hi>lutum DEI,</hi> as GODS clay:<note place="margin">The Neceſſity of Vowe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

In deed, ſaith hee, if it were an <hi>outward</hi> neceſſitie, and not <hi>aſsumed,</hi> it were ſomewhat they ſaid: but concerning neceſſitie hee ſaith, <hi>foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix neceſsitas, quae compellit ad meliora:</hi> that neceſſitie is true happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that maketh a man doe that that is beſt for him. This is beſt done, when it is done, either <hi>voto ſimplici,</hi> by a bare and <hi>ſimple</hi> Vow; or in a <hi>ſolemne</hi> Vow before others. Now then beſides this, that it <hi>ſtrengtheneth</hi> mans will in goodneſſe, and ſo maketh our deedes the more <hi>acceptable</hi> to GOD, as the ſtiffe and ſetled purpoſe of the ſinner maketh his ſinne worſe; ſo this reſolution, that hee will not goe backe, it worketh yet further, and maketh his <hi>good</hi> thing the <hi>better:</hi> For there is nothing that wee doe under a <hi>Vow,</hi> but in this reſpect it becommeth a <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> That we doe it vowing, becauſe wee have pledged it to GOD: And not onely that, but alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the Vow, which is acceptable to GOD; there is a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> made to him of our owne <hi>freedome</hi> and <hi>libertie:</hi> yea, of our <hi>power.</hi> So then a man reſteth not on his owne perſon, to doe theſe actions which hee will: but hee hath made over his power to GOD, and bindeth himſelfe to it: ſo that now hee reſteth not of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                        <p>So then certaine it is that men have freedome, and libertie: as

                        <p n="1">1. Wee ſee, that they have begunne with <hi>themſelves,</hi> and that in two reſpects.

                        </p>
                        <p>So ſecondly wee find, that a man may vow <hi>ſuos,</hi> not only him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, but his: as his <hi>children</hi> as <hi>Anna,</hi> 1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.11.28. vowed <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel.

                        </p>

For the time of affliction, binding our ſelves to ſome generall action. There the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in time of danger vowed a vow: and it was allowed. But that <hi>Jonah</hi> 1.16. a vow, not before, <hi>for</hi> deliverance, but <hi>after</hi> deliverance; thoſe vowes that are vowed <hi>in tranquillo,</hi> in a Calme, are moſt accepted of GOD.</p>

                        <p n="4">4. The fourth <hi>Precept</hi> and <hi>Rule,</hi> is; That this Law is <hi>Spirituall:</hi> That is as much to ſay, as, Becauſe in the beginning, the <hi>Name</hi> was but an object of <hi>ſpeech: Eſa.</hi> 29.13.</p>
                        <p>That this <hi>ſwearing, vowing, ſpeaking</hi> of the <hi>Name</hi> of GOD, it returneth to that place, that all thoſe things, if they bee done with the <hi>lipps</hi> onely, and our <hi>hearts</hi> bee farre from them: wee are in the number of thoſe, that with <hi>lipps</hi> come <hi>neare;</hi> but are <hi>farre off</hi> with their <hi>hearts.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>A ſort of people, that pervert the true worſhip of GOD: That the heart ſhold firſt come, and the lipps attend upon it. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gustine</hi> in his tenth <hi>Booke</hi> of <hi>Confeſſ. Cap.</hi> 33. ſaith <hi>flete mecum fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tres, &amp; flete pro me;</hi> and in that place hee confeſſeth thoſe infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that were in him, and what is the thing that hee deſired to bee moved from: It is, That in finging <hi>Pſalmes</hi> in the Church, hee did more ſet his mind upon the <hi>Tune,</hi> than to pleaſe GOD in the <hi>matter. Animus enim meus magis erat ad cantum, quam ad id quod cantabatur.</hi> Which hee confeſſeth to be a great fault. The ſumme or effect is this: That the exerciſes performed to GOD with the <hi>mouth,</hi> when as there is nothing elſe but a <hi>noyſe,</hi> as the crac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of Thornes burning under a pott, there is a lowd voyce, but a dumbe affection, it is a thing lamentable; and therefore, to bee left of us.</p>
                        <p>Yet it is not to bee doubted, but the man had many good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48000:166"/>as he ſaith, <hi>Ita ſaepe facio non ſentiens:</hi> but <hi>poſtquam feci, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio,</hi> I doe ſo often, and I perceive it not; but after I have done it, I perceive it, that I have done it. And this might be wiſhed that we might feele it, when we have done it, we be farre from theſe ſayings.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Meanes,</hi> the inducing meanes:<note place="margin">The Meanes.</note> For a man to eſteeme Gods name Holy, may be the conſideration of <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.3. that he hath likewiſe magnified our names greatly, inſomuch as hee hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtred them in the Booke of life. And not onely that, but as it is, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.16. even as we were his owne in the World, ſo he is ours: and he is not aſhamed to be called <hi>Deus noſter,</hi> our God; that we ſhould not be aſhamed of his name; and that he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted our names to ſo honourable a Booke; theſe be wayes and meanes to induce us unto it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſecond way or meanes how to performe it; that before we can come to glorifie him, we muſt be perſwaded that the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which we doe, are for his glory; and wee muſt learne what actions pleaſe him: and before we have aſſurance of them, wee muſt have them before us; but we have none, but in examples of thoſe in former ages, before our time: And they little affect us, becauſe either we thinke that they pertaine not to us; or if they pertaine to us, we are in doubt whether they be ſo or no: or elſe if wee thinke they are true, wee thinke that God had glory and praiſe enough in thoſe dayes; and we have but little preſent uſe of it. And therefore counſell hath beene given, that as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten of every man of God, of <hi>Nathan, Gad,</hi> and the reſt of the Children of the Prophets: that every man had <hi>annales,</hi> from the beginning of his time, that he might ſee the viſible judgements of God that he had ſhewed upon his enemies; and a Catalogue of his mercies on his Children, to be reverenced among men: and joyning the preſent examples with thoſe that are paſt, one ſhall not be an impediment to another; neither thoſe that were before ſhall ſeeme incredible, becauſe wee ſee them, or the like done in our dayes: and on the contrary, ours ſhall not ſeeme ſtrange, becauſe we ſee the like done before.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. Another is, a Dexterity which we ſee in Chriſt, and in the ſervants of Chriſt; wherein they had ſo inured themſelves, from every action and creature to the glory of God; ſo that there was nothing could be ſpoken, nothing done, nothing heard, but they would make uſe of it to returne to Gods glory: as <hi>Luke</hi> 8.12. Chriſt, by occaſion of being early in the Temple, and the Sunne ſhining bright, tooke occaſion to fall into large diſcourſe of the Sunne of the World, and Heavenly light; and concerning the Naturall darkneſſe of man, and made a fruitfull ſpeech of it. And <hi>John</hi> 6.26. upon the inquiry of them how he came thither; and his anſwer, that that queſtion was moved rather becauſe they would have their dinner againe then for the Miracle they ſaw, and upon ſome ſmall ſpeech of <hi>Manna,</hi> there was an occaſion of his great Sermon of the Sacrament, and the Bread of life.

                           </list> CHRIST there entreth into three very fruitfull Exhortations or admonitions, directly tending to the Glorie of GOD. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 5. by going downe to the Vineyard, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.1. by going downe to the potters ſhop. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. by a blind altar, by <hi>Eſaie, Jeremie</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> occaſions were taken to confound the <hi>Jewes,</hi> and to convert the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> When every man ſtudieth to attaine to this <hi>aptneſſe,</hi> no thing can bee offered, but ſome ſeaſoned talke would bee rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from it, and GOD daylie glorified.</p>
                        <p>The laſt is, <hi>by a reverent behaviour in our ſpeech,</hi> not only of GODS Name, and credit: but alſo of that which hee hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us, as a <hi>meanes</hi> to it. Whatſoever the Name of GOD is <hi>printed</hi> on, <hi>id est,</hi> whatſoever is called by the Name of GOD. For there is no name that CHRIST had, as JESUS, and SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOUR, &amp;c. there is none of them, but <hi>Men</hi> had and were called by them. Onely this Name <hi>Verbum,</hi> the Word, none ever had it: that men might know, that that Name was <hi>most est emeed</hi> of GOD; and in the higheſt degree. <hi>Act.</hi> 9.15. by the judgement of late and beſt Writers, where <hi>Paul</hi> is ſaid, hee ſhould carrie GODS <hi>Name</hi> before the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> that is nothing elſe but his <hi>Word.</hi> Becauſe it is an eſpeciall meanes for the magnifying of His Name. And <hi>Zach.</hi> 10.12. the abominable and curſed practiſe of ſundrie ungracious perſons, condemned by all the ſacred <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells,</hi> that ever have beene, and <hi>anathematized,</hi> and accompted ſo groſſe a fault in <hi>Poperie,</hi> as that the <hi>Counſell</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> 4. <hi>ſect.</hi> laſt, puniſhed it: that is, for applying ſacred ſentences of this <hi>Word</hi> to prophane <hi>libells</hi> and <hi>jeasts.</hi> What ſhall wee ſay, ſaith <hi>Augustine:</hi> but onely that theſe men ſet themſelves in a way, by neglecting GODS Gift; <hi>id est,</hi> His <hi>Word,</hi> after to neglect His Name: ſo by neglecting GODS Word, not to ſticke to ſweare by great and blaſphemous oaths.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Signes.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">The Signes.</note> As in the firſt ſignification of a <hi>Burthen,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it to a Chriſtian <hi>Oath;</hi> ſo here, when our <hi>Neceſsitie</hi> is not ſought, but the <hi>Glorie</hi> of GOD, when a <hi>Burthen.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>As it is compared to a <hi>Banner</hi> or <hi>Standard,</hi> the example of the Name, and the behaviour of a man to that, may ſhew us, whether wee bee aright. For in the Hoſte, they ſtood ſtill when their Standard ſtood ſtill, and they moved, when their Standard moved. So if there bee any man that for his actions, meditations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes, that ſtandeth ſo affected, that hee can goe, and will goe ſo farre as the Banner goeth: ſo farre as GODS Glorie leadeth him, and that ſtanding, hee will goe no further. Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever fleſh and worldly powers and reaſons would allure him to goe further. If wee bee at the Commandement of the Glorie of GOD, then wee have the firſt Signe. There are many, that when
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48000:167"/>that ſtandeth ſtill, goe; and when that calleth backe, goe further; and yet neither come to leave off nor to doe: When Gods glory is to be ſought, they ſit ſtill; and when it calleth them backe, they goe on. Theſe men are farre from the firſt ſigne.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſecond ſigne, and that was a part in the <hi>Graecians</hi> &amp; <hi>Romans</hi> oathes, at the entring of them, firſt, into the Campe, when they were ſworne Souldiers: <hi>Pugnabo pro ſacris, &amp; ſolus, &amp; cum aliis;</hi> he would fight for it alone, and with company alſo: This is a plaine ſigne, whereby the World is condemned of not ſeeking his glory: if all turne, he will turne; he ſhall have no glory, <hi>â ſolis:</hi> for it is, <hi>cum aliis</hi> that getteth God the glory: but if they ſhrinke away, there are but few that will keep the ſecond part of their oath, that will ſtand <hi>ſoli,</hi> themſelves alone by the ſtandard, when the whole Realme runneth to Apoſtacie.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third is this, That whoſoever belonged to one ſtandard, or had once profeſſed that hee was of that band, it was preſent death, if either in mouth hee had <hi>hoſtile ſymbolum,</hi> or about him, <hi>hostilem teſſeram.</hi> If he had the enemies Watch-word, or their Badge, it was death. Now I would know (but every one may know by ſeeing and hearing) there are ſome that profeſſe Chriſt in outward behaviour and ſhew, that in their gates and apparrell are oppoſite to this; there are plaine <hi>Teſſarae,</hi> Badges of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and if you heare them ſpeake, they have the right Watchword of the Devill: Worldly ſpeeches and worldly ſignes; and that we doe <hi>militari carni &amp; ſanguini,</hi> we weare them daily; and ſo by this we may examine our ſelves.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. The fourth, <hi>The periſhing of a righteous man in his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> It was the manner of the delivering of the ſtandard among the <hi>Lacedaemonians,</hi>

                        </p>
                        <p n="5">5. Laſt, How to others, we may be perſwaded for the procuring of it in them alſo. The Apoſtles precept, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. our ſpeech muſt be ſuch, as the hearers may receive grace, and have profit by it. It hath a place in the ſecond Commandement; and not onely in ſpeech, but alſo (as Chriſt ſaith) in Workes, &amp;c. And as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. <hi>Eſay</hi> 52.2. that men blaſpheme not the Word of God by your unreformed lives; that men ſay not, this word is a word, not of power, but may ſay it is a Religion of ſtrength; that they ſay not, that our Religion is Unweaponed, or a Favourer of Vice.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>Penalty</hi> of the Commandement,<note place="margin">Penaltie.</note> 
                           <hi>God will not hold him guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe:</hi> that is, as before in the ſecond Commandement; he ſaith, hee will fall downe to an Image, becauſe hee will ſpare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; he ſhall not need to begge: therefore he will fall downe: but God upon that ſaith, they ſhall all fare the worſe for it; hee
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:48000:168"/>will viſit him and his children to the third and fourth generation: So here is a <hi>Fruſtra, quod non erit fruſtra,</hi> here is a taking of Gods name in vaine, which will not prove in vaine; for he will come in judgement: they to ſave themſelves from ſome preſent danger, will take his name in vaine; but here cometh not an holding Guiltleſſe, but a Condemning for it. It ſhall turne to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, where he thought to be ſaved. The reaſon why God annexed here a penalty, as before, the great gaine a man might reape by changing his Religion. So here, when there is a great profit, then there is a great penalty ſet upon them, that breake it. So here, <hi>Ubi lapſus eſt, in procliui,</hi> as a mans tongue (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) <hi>Poſita eſt in udo,</hi> is ſet in a glio and ſlippery place: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it is, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 141.3. God muſt ſet a doore and a lock upon our lips. And that doore is, <hi>Thou ſhalt not be held guiltleſſe:</hi> that is, if ye be called Chriſtians, and take upon you a vaine profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make fruſtrate Gods name. For a Chriſtian muſt depart from wickedneſſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 75.5.<hi>I ſaid to the fooles, deale not ſo madly, and to the ungodly, ſet not up your horne.</hi> If you take upon you any other name, if you defend not this, or defend things oppoſed to this, in Diſputations maintaine falſe Doctrine; if in your ſpeech you bury the name of God; or if you bury it not, but talke of it fooliſhly and vainely, and without feare and reverence; if in talke you forget it, if you ſpeake evill of Gods name, by diſliking of his mercies beſtowed upon any, or his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if you, when you ſhould bleſſe his name, you take it and apply it to Witchcraft and Sorceries, and evill things: If when you ſhould bleſſe others, ye make it a By-word to curſe them by it. If in ſwearing you take it in vaine; if you vow and doe not performe; if any of theſe wayes you blaſpheme God; How then? Then it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord will not hold him guiltleſſe.</hi> And it is well ſaid: for it is he indeed that muſt doe it; for the World will hold him guiltleſſe; as ſwearers now a dayes are not puniſhed. For a man that ſhould empaire a mans name, I have better remedy for it, then for the blaſphemie of the name of God: He ſhall not goe ſcot-free, for ſlandering my name; but Gods name findeth not ſo much favour of our Law. Therefore becauſe the World regardeth it ſo little, it is neceſſary that the Lord ſhould take it into his hands: the Lord will looke to it.</p>
                        <p>Not to be held Guiltleſſe, is the whole matter: for who is there that ſhall not fall into intollerable and endleſſe trouble, if the Lord hold him not Guiltleſſe: For every man is guilty before God; and if he found him guiltie, yet he will not be accompted guiltie; but this name ſhall not be holden guiltleſſe, <hi>Hic eſt totus fructus, ut auferatur peccatum,</hi> this is the whole fruit, that our ſinne may be taken away; elſe we are the moſt miſerable creatures, if we lived alwayes in Vaine.</p>
                        <p>Becauſe Gods threatnings in the Law pertaine as well to this life, as to the life to come; and we ſaid before, that there is no Commandement that ever God hath ſet downe, that there is ſo
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:48000:168"/>fearefull judgements in this age, and in the age before, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry age, as this hath had. <hi>Zach.</hi> 5.4. The Prophet ſetteth there a flying Booke, and that was to take hold of the houſe of the Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and to conſume the Poſts, Tymber, Stones, and all. For ſtoning, <hi>Levit.</hi> 24.11. to ſtone the Perjured perſon to death, <hi>Num.</hi> 5.21. <hi>Then the Prieſt ſhall charge the Woman with an oath of curſing, and he ſhall ſay to the woman, The Lord make thee be accurſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable for the oath among the people, and the Lord cauſe thy thigh to to rott, and thy belly to ſwell, verſ.</hi> 22. And that this muſty water may goe into thy bowels, to cauſe thy belly to ſwell and thy thighes to rot. And not onely in theſe private perſons; but <hi>Jer.</hi> 21.7. the plagues of God againſt whole Nations, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. the plague of a Famine. <hi>Shall hee proſper, ſhall hee eſcape that doth theſe things? or ſhall he breake the Covenant, and be delivered? Ezek.</hi> 17.16. Deſtruction and Captivity on a whole Land. And there are bookes of this thing alone: and of particuler perſons and whole Nations God hath ſhewed manifeſt judgements: And this cannot otherwiſe be, becauſe we are ſo zealous and carefull of our name, how much more is God of his? For his name paſſeth ours. We ſay, and it is a common By-word among us, <hi>What is a man, but his good name?</hi> 2. They ſay, <hi>Crudelis eſt ſibi homo, qui famam ſuam negligit, aut inultam ſinit,</hi> He is a cruell man that neglecteth his name: that God ſhould be negligent, if he ſhould not puniſh it. <hi>Et ſolius laeſae famae cauſa duellum eſt permittendum, quia fama ambu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat pari paſſu cum vitâ,</hi> the taking away of a mans life, that taketh away his good name. Then if we for our owne names ſake be thus zealous: and ſo, if it be for the name of our Father, or any of thoſe that we receive benefit by, wee will thinke ill of our ſelves, if we take not the quarrell upon us: God is not to be accuſed, to puniſh thoſe that take his name in vaine.</p>
                        <p>To conclude, as it is moſt certaine that Gods name is glorious in it ſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.1. <hi>How glorious is thy name in all the World?</hi> So it muſt be in every one of us. If thou wilt, it ſhall be glorified by thee willingly; if thou wilt not, in ſpite of thy teeth, whether thou wilt or no, he will be glorified, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.4. <hi>And I will har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> Pharaohs <hi>heart, ſo I will get me honour upon</hi> Pharaoh <hi>and upon all his Hoſt.

                        </p>
                        <p>The end of the Sabbath. A great and holy aſſembly, for this end; either that they might be ſanctified and all taught; or that they might practice them to his glory in the great congregation. It is true, and that the Heathen man ſaw well, <hi>Publicorum cura mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> the common care is not the beſt care: But that that is looked to of all, is cared for of none; and cometh to be regarded of none: and ſo no doubt would men have dealt with God, had not he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a particuler day for himſelfe, and ſetled it by a Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that in very particuler manner. By that continuall and
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:48000:169"/>generall Sabbath, they have no day of reſt. The drift of God in adding this Commandement, ſhall be ſeene.</p>
                        <p>For the Commandement it ſelfe; generally it is full out as long and longer then the ſecond Commandement: of many words, and therefore moveth us to a due, and no leſſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. We ſee for the duties of the ſecond Table; foure of them are ended in a word: becauſe common honeſty, and writers; as Philoſophers, politick and civill Lawes, have taken order for them: as in manſlaughter, whoredome, and theft, &amp;c: but the fifth, becauſe God ſeeth there is an humour in us, that will not willingly yeeld to ſubjection; therefore it was neceſſary that God ſhould fence it with a reaſon: So likewiſe in the tenth, there is a great particularity uſed in it; becauſe men thinke that their thoughts are free, and not to come into judgement; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they may have their Concupiſcence and Will free. But now in the firſt Table, every Commandement hath his reaſon: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them all in particular, this Commandement, it includeth ſix reſpects, that are not found in any of the reſt.</p>

                           <item>3.

                              </gap>,</hi> ſuch a reſt is plainely ſet downe, <hi>Levit.</hi> 25. When the Land hath beene laboured and tilled ſix yeares; he chargeth it to be ſuffered to reſt the ſeventh yeare, and lye fallow: a politick Law. So that after a labour of ſix dayes, this is it that God requireth, that there ſhould be a day of ceaſing. <hi>Sanctifying</hi> is here attributed to two in this Commandement; in the end, that the Lord ſanctifyed the Sabbath; here in the beginning, that wee muſt remember to ſanctifie it.</p>
                        <p>The rule in Divinity is, that where any word is given to God and to Man, that to God is applyed, <hi>Sub modo deſtinandi:</hi> to Man, <hi>Sub modo applicandi.</hi> When God doth <hi>appoint</hi> a thing to an holy uſe, he is ſaid to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> it: when a man <hi>applyeth</hi> it to that end, whereunto God hath appointed it, he is ſaid to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> it.</p>
                        <p>It is ſure that by nature all are alike before God; and men dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not by nature: and ſo may it be ſaid of Water, Bread, Wine, and Dayes, &amp;c. by nature all are alike, and of it ſelfe, one is not more holy then another; but <hi>Levit.</hi> 20.26. the firſt action, God ſaith, <hi>I have put you apart from all people, that you ſhould bee mine.</hi> When God putteth a man apart, that he ſhould be his, whether his in the common wealth, or in the Church to doe it there; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Magiſtrate or Miniſter, then this ſeparation is the beginning of a ſanctifying. So of that Water, that is ſeparated to Baptiſme; and in the creatures of Bread and Wine, there is no more in them naturally then in others; till they be put apart, from the reſt of the Water and Bread and Wine, and made Gods, that is, appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to an uſe in his Church. And ſo likewiſe of dayes naturally, there is not more holineſſe in one of them then in another; onely it is the Ordinance of God that maketh the ſeparation of it, from the other to become his. The common uſe, that a man doth ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate to the Lord of all that he hath, whether it be man or beaſt, may neither be ſold, nor redeemed; for every thing ſeparate from the common uſe, is moſt holy to the Lord.</p>
                        <p>Now the nature of ſuch things is, as <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.28. Every thing that is ſeparate from common uſe, is moſt holy to the Lord; and it muſt neither be ſold nor redeemed: therefore we ſee that <hi>Exod.</hi> 28, 29, 30. <hi>Chap.</hi> For his Tabernacle, the fireforks, pothooks, fleſhooks, made for the Sacrifice, and the baſeſt inſtruments made for the fire to ſtirre it up, and the meate in the Caldrons, whereof a <hi>libamen,</hi> (or offering) ſhould not be put in any other fire; and the Snuffers to no other Lamps, but thoſe of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle: all onely to this. So this is the nature of a thing ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:48000:170"/>and how it differeth from other things. Other things may ſerve, if they be done in part; this it muſt not be done in part, but onely and wholly, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1.2. Meditation every day and every night doth well; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.2. Every day he will praiſe God: and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.17. he will do it thrice a day, in the Evening, Morning, and Noone: and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.164. he will doe it ſeven times a day, becauſe of his righteous judgements: Yet all theſe are but in part; for in theſe dayes other things may be done joyntly with it, and they may take alſo a part of the day lawfully; but here is the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference: This day the moſt holy day and ſeparated to Gods uſe, this it muſt be done onely and wholly, not in part, nor joyntly with any other exerciſe.</p>
                        <p>Now the queſtion is, wherefore it pleaſed God to deale thus with that day to ſanctifie it, (as we ſee it was) before any ſinne came into the World? as <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. whether it be for himſelfe, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.25. <hi>To the cleane, all things are cleane; to the holy all things are holy.</hi> God is moſt holy and needeth nothing to be ſanctified to him: if not for him, therefore for us. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Our ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is the will and pleaſure of God:</hi> And conſequently to the end we might be made holy, he hath hallowed the day, his Word, &amp;c. So by the ſecond way or part of ſanctification, by annexing a bleſſing to them, he bleſſed it; and in the Bread of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.26. he bleſt the bread; and his <hi>dicere</hi> is <hi>facere;</hi> that is, he gave it a power of doing good. As to his bread, ſo to his day; and hath it in two ſorts of holineſſe: Firſt, for whereas the place is ſaid to be holy, as the place whereon <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtood, and all that belonged to the Tabernacle, becauſe they were meanes unto holineſſe.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, ſo the fruit is another uſe; when as holineſſe is wrought and brought forth in practice <hi>(Sanctificamini, &amp; ſancti eſtote)</hi> then it commeth to thus much, God hath put apart this day, to the end that it might bee applyed wholly either to the meanes of ſanctification, or to the practice of his ſanctification begotten in us. Chriſt, <hi>Mark</hi> 2. did a good Sabbath dayes worke, and he hath given it a bleſſing; that is, that what meanes of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication we uſe in it, the meditation that wee have in it, it ſhall be of more effect and force to us, then it ſhould be on any other day not ſanctified.</p>
                        <p>Then if we ſee how God hath ſanctified it, wee muſt ſee how we muſt doe: <hi>(i. e.)</hi> As he by his bleſſing ſanctifieth it, ſo we muſt ſanctifie it by our obedience.</p>
                        <p>In two parts; firſt, in eſtimation or account, that is for our judgement: ſecondly, in our uſe, that is for our practice.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, we muſt account of it as a day holy to God; <hi>Acts</hi> 10.15. we muſt not count it common. What God hath cleanſed, that muſt not be counted common; our judgement muſt be of it, that it be not common; but as a Magiſtrate is among men, ſo that muſt be a day of dayes.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, our uſe that we ſo uſe it: The uſe is excellently ſet
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48000:171"/>downe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13. that wee doe not our owne buſineſſe, that thinking of common thoughts, take not up our braines, nor com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon communication; and that our behaviour be ſanctified, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the practice of holineſſe. <hi>Hag.</hi> 2.14. It is plaine, that if that that is ſanctified, touch that, that is common, it imputeth not holineſſe to that that is common, but it receiveth unholineſſe from it: So that the touching of an unholy action in our life that day, is a polluting of the day of the Lord. This wee muſt take heed to, as much as in us lyeth: elſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. as our Saviour there ſheweth, a woman may be chaſte, and yet adultery may be committed, if a wicked eye looke on her, to luſt after her; there is adultery, though the party remaine chaſte: ſo in reſpect of holy things, they remaine holy, yet we doe pollute them, when as by touching profane things, we labour as much as in us lyeth to make them unholy.</p>
                        <p>Here are two things, and both commanded; but not equally, but the one for the other: for ſanctification is the laſt end and drift of God, and the meanes and practice of it onely and wholly is his chiefe end, and is the end of the other. Now the other, the <hi>reſt,</hi> is a ſubordinate end, becauſe without it, this matter will not be brought to paſſe in that order that God requireth.</p>
                        <p>To the making it plaine, thus much; that the Heathen men by the light of nature have ſeene, that every thing is then beſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it hath but one office, and is ordained to doe but one thing; that is, whatſoever is done, it muſt throughly be done; it muſt be alonely done, the reaſon is, becauſe we are <hi>res integra fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nita,</hi> finite creatures: and if two things be done at once, one part of our thoughts will be taken from the other, we cannot wholly intend two things at once; this is our caſe. But it was the caſe of our Father <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency; becauſe he had a naturall ſoule, and finite, therefore he was not able wholly to intend the dreſſing of the Garden in ſix dayes, and to intend the whole ſanctification of the day of reſt, commanded <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. now becauſe of this, God would have a ſolemne profeſſion of body and ſoule; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this was the end, why God inſtituted, bleſſed and ſanctified the ſeventh day; ſo that it commeth for a remedy againſt <hi>diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be intended to any other uſe, eſpecially in the ſolemne wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Lord; that takes up the whole man, and neceſſarily ſuffereth no diſtraction; therefore it doth not ſuffer him to be intended to any other uſe. Now, if being then in that caſe, he could not: we that have more impediments to withdraw us, we had need of a remedy againſt our diſtraction. And thus cometh the reſt in, becauſe that this totall ſolemne ſanctification cannot be performed without ceaſing from the reſt of our workes, and labour; becauſe unleſſe we doe reſt, we cannot ſanctifie. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is it, that this is commanded, with our ſanctification, a day of reſt; otherwiſe, whereas our reſting hindreth our ſanctification, it muſt bee taken away. And indeed Chriſt doth acknowledge, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.27. that man was not made for the reſt, but for ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48000:171"/>Sanctification was his end, and man was made for it: reſt is a ſubordinate end, and man was not made for it, but rather that for man; and as it is, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. a mans bodily labour, ſo his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily reſt profiteth nothing, but to this end applyed, God liketh it not.</p>
                        <p>There is beſide in the commandement another word <hi>Remember,</hi> and becauſe that is properly of a thing paſt, therefore it referreth to ſome place or time before; and there is mention of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath but in two places before, one is <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.23.24.25. but that is not it; for God in the end, adding (God bleſſed it) referreth us to that place, where the ſame words are: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. and ſo we know that we are referred thither: And by this occaſion falleth in that firſt queſtion, that many thinke it is a Ceremony, and ſundry are ſo perſwaded, and hold that men are not bound to ſanctifie it ſince Chriſt. Our Saviour in the caſe of difference, and reſolution of <hi>Polygamie;</hi> hath taken a good courſe and order, hee goeth to the beginning; how it was <hi>ab initio, non ſic ab initio,</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not ſo: to call it to the firſt inſtitution; for that is it, that giveth the beſt judgement, and the laſt: firſt end is the true end. A thing is not ſaid to be ceremoniall, if a ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all uſe or end be annexed to it; for then not one of the tenne mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Commandements, but it ſhould bee ceremoniall: for they have ſome ceremonie annexed to them: but that is a ceremony, whoſe firſt and principall end is a ceremonie; which this day of reſt cannot be. The reaſon, becauſe Paradiſe and mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and a ceremony cannot agree, in the ſtate of a mans inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cencie. The reaſon is, becauſe that before there was a Saviour, there could not be a type of a Saviour: and before there was ſin, there needed no Saviour: So conſequently, needing no Saviour, needed no ceremony; and needing no Saviour, nor ceremonie, it could not be ceremoniall. But that was it, that <hi>Adam</hi> having in the ſix dayes a naturall uſe in his body of the creatures, ſhould for the glory of God on the ſeventh day, have a ſpirituall uſe and conſideration. So that this remedy againſt Diſtraction is the firſt and principall, and generall end; though other ends were after added: as <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. it pleaſed God to add this reaſon, that they might remember the benefit of the deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt;</hi> but this was but <hi>finis poſterior,</hi> a particular and after end, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. So it were well if we might add to our dayes of reſt the memory of our benefits. And <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.12. God yeeldeth a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique end; the ceaſing of beaſts and men that they may returne more freſh to their labour: there is moreover no better nor cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainer way to keepe off our enemies: thoſe <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. thoſe ſpirituall wickedneſſes, the preaching of the Law then is a meane to enable us to withſtand the crafty and ſubtile ſuggeſtions of ſin and Satan. And if any will ſay, that beſide theſe ends, there was figured by this reſt, that reſt we ſhall have from ſinne by Chriſts death: True, but yet it is an acceſſorie end; in the Sacrament of Circumciſion, Circumciſion is ceaſed, and
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48000:172"/>the <hi>Paſsover,</hi> ſo is the Sabbath: but the Sacrament of <hi>initiation</hi> is not ceaſed, there were two ends of it.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>1. The firſt, was to <hi>ſeale</hi> us, to his <hi>preventing</hi> or <hi>following</hi> Grace.</item>
                           <item>2. The other to bee a figure of the circumciſion of the <hi>Heart:</hi> of the Sacrifice of the world, this is ceaſed. So the ſeventh day is ceaſed; but there is another day: there is a day remaining; becauſe the end of it was <hi>immutable</hi> from the beginning. The reaſon of it ſelfe is ſo forceable and plaine, that without bringing in a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt abſurditie, it cannot bee avoided, when they ſee theſe endes to carry us to the <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and that in <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> But you will ſay, <hi>Adam</hi> never kept it, neither was it kept till <hi>Exod.</hi> 16. Which ſhould in the very miſliking, ſeeme an abſurd thing, that GOD two thouſand yeares, before a thing ſhould bee put in uſe, ſhould conſecrate that thing to <hi>Sanctification:</hi> and all that while it ſhould bee to no <hi>End:</hi> And indeed the ſort of the <hi>Heretikes</hi> that held, that <hi>materia prima,</hi> was ſo made of GOD a great many yeares before the world, and it abode by him till the world was made. They are confounded by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> by this, that no man of wiſdome doth make any thing to ſtand by him, many yeares before it can bee put to any uſe: Therefore, GOD uſeth not ſo to doe: but when hee ſhall have uſe of any thing, then to bleſſe it. This prooveth, that this day reſteth on the conſciences of men, and that the inſtitution riſeth from GOD immediately, even in <hi>Adams</hi> innocencie.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Wee muſt underſtand, that <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.13. GOD maketh there a plaine diſtinction betweene <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and the <hi>morall</hi> law, by this manner. That the one proceedeth from him <hi>immediatelie:</hi> the other by the <hi>ministerie</hi> of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that very ſame is <hi>Deutere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nom.</hi> 5.31.</p>
                        <p>Againe, beſide the <hi>Confuſion</hi> and breach of <hi>Order,</hi> a thing which GOD miſliketh; one of the Fathers, on theſe words ſaith, <hi>Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid &amp; Saul est inter Prophetas?</hi> What is <hi>Saul</hi> amongſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets? Not a Prophet by profeſſion: they wondred at it, that hee ſhould bee amongſt the Prophets: one ſaith, that <hi>Saul</hi> is <hi>hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneum</hi> amongſt the Prophets: it will fall againſt order for a <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall</hi> precept to ſtand in the middeſt amongſt <hi>morall</hi> comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. For every Ceremonie or Type, becauſe it was a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling of the <hi>Goſpell:</hi> therefore, muſt bee referred to the Goſpell, as the ſhadow to the bodie: for indeed Ceremonies are Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.

                        <p>Againe; when CHRIST delivereth to the Scribes the <hi>ſumme</hi> of the <hi>ten</hi> Commandements, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the LORD,</hi> &amp;c. It is no queſtion, but it is a ſumme of the Commandements. Then in that part of the ſumme, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.

                        <p>Laſtly; a dangerous way is taken for bringing in one Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie: and the Papiſts, as <hi>Paroſius</hi> and <hi>Politian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Therefore, the beſt inſtitution, the beſt way for upholding the duties <hi>Eternall</hi> and to keepe them without blemiſh, is to hold that part of the <hi>ten</hi> Commandements, to deny all <hi>Ceremonies</hi> in the law, as comming of the nature of the Commandement: but they are plainly <hi>Morall.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="6">6. To come to the time of the <hi>Goſpel, Eph.</hi> 2.15. wee hold that all ceremonies are ended, and abrogated by CHRISTS death: but the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is not, which is plaine, by <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.20. for there CHRIST denouncing, the overthrow of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> bids them pray, that their calamitie befall not in the winter, or on the <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath</hi> day. Wee know this deſtruction fell out long and many years after CHRISTS death, when all ceremonies were ended, the <hi>Vaile</hi> rent, &amp;c. Now then if hee ſhould have prayed that their flight might not bee on the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> and that were abrogated as a <hi>Ceremonie,</hi> hee ſhould have prayed that it might not have beene on that day, which indeed ſhould have beene no day. Therefore, it is neceſſarie that it bee counted no <hi>Ceremonie.</hi>

                        <p n="7">7. Another is, that to chop and change one day for another, is not <hi>abrogatio,</hi> but <hi>commutatio Judaiſmi.</hi> 2. So the <hi>Seales</hi> of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of their owne nature are thinges morall, though in regard of ſome other reſpect they bee ceremoniall. Yet in the other that are <hi>meere typicall;</hi> there is no manner of commutation, but they are cleane taken away: for if wee grant that the waxe candles, the copes, &amp;c. are not the <hi>Jewes,</hi> but <hi>changed,</hi> where as <hi>Judaiſme</hi> is not to bee: but as it is <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Hee hath broken downe the wall, hee hath taken away,</hi> &amp;c. It is manifeſt that in ſtead of the <hi>Jewes</hi> ſeventh day, in the <hi>Apostles</hi> dayes another ſeventh day was ordained. Therefore, it was not as the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> but as the <hi>Ministerie</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>Seales</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> and the <hi>Day</hi> of the <hi>Covenant.</hi> For wee ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. where as the Apoſtles called together the Diſciples in the <hi>first</hi> day of the weeke, (which is our <hi>Sabbath</hi> now) to heare the Word, and breake bread. And 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. hee willeth them in their meetinges they ſhould every one in the <hi>first</hi> day of the weeke, put aſide by him, and lay up as GOD had proſpered him, that there might not bee ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theringes when hee came.

                        <p>So then we ſee plainly, in the whole time the Apoſtles lived, it
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48000:173"/>being <hi>changed</hi> by them, and not <hi>taken away.</hi> Therefore, not of the nature of the <hi>Types</hi> of the Law.

For as then nothing was more memorable then the day of his <hi>Creation:</hi> ſo when it pleaſed GOD that old thinges ſhould ceaſe, there was a benefit that did over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow the former. Therefore, from that day, wee now celebrate the memoriall of CHRISTS <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and became of the other worke alſo concurring fifty dayes after, the great and ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimable benefit of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and the people by ſpeaking with ſtrange tongues, and the memorie of the benefit of creation being as well ſhewed in the firſt day of the weeke, as in the laſt: and ſo have wee it by great reaſon eſtabliſhed of the <hi>Creation, Redemption, Sanctification,</hi> of the three ſpeciall benefites wrought by the three Perſons.

                        <list>
                           <item>1. By right of <hi>Creation</hi> we are GODS, and all ours; for he made us of nothing; and ſo might <hi>challenge us,</hi> and our <hi>dayes:</hi> ſo that ſtanding in this caſe, we could not challenge one day to our ſelves: inſomuch as if it had pleaſed GOD but to give us but one day, and had reſerved the other ſixe to himſelfe, wee had no juſt cauſe of complaining. But if hee had dealt thus liberally with us, to grant us day for day, wee ſhould not have murmured, but have opened our mouthes to prayſe Him: then the order hee hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:48000:173"/>now, if we be not cleane voyde of good nature, muſt needs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent us: in granting to us ſix, and reſerving to himſelfe but one. Wee ſee likewiſe GODS bountifulneſſe with <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2. When hee granted him <hi>all</hi> the Trees in the Garden except <hi>one:</hi> then preſently the Devill was at him, and upbraided him with GODS niggardneſſe; that he had not granted him all the Trees of the Garden: <hi>may yee not eat of all the trees?</hi> &amp;c. And ſo no doubt the Devill uſeth this pollicie now a dayes in this; <hi>May yee not doe what yee will all the dayes of the weeke?</hi> The conſideration of this, the great bountie of GOD. That wee cannot ſay, but that wee are well dealt withall, having granted to us two times and a time, ſix dayes, to his <hi>one</hi> time: and conſequently that wee bee carefull to give him his. And that by this great liberalitie wee may learne to make him a better anſwer then <hi>Adam</hi> did: and ſay as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his <hi>Mistris, Gen.</hi> 39.9. <hi>All that is in the houſe, my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath granted mee; onely thee hath hee reſerved for himſelfe; how then can I doe this thing?</hi> So that our anſwer bee: <hi>all</hi> the dayes of the weeke hee hath granted us, onely <hi>one</hi> day hee hath reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: how then can I bee ſo unkinde, as not to let him have that? Hee having granted ſo richly and largely: And if not that; then to paterne our ſelves by <hi>David,</hi> 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.5. hee being ſo richly provided, for of GOD, if that one ſheepe the poore man hath, he will not ſuffer, but pull it out of his boſome: ſo we if we cannot ſuffer that one ſheepe, but plucke it out of GODS boſome, and make it common to our ſelves, having many of our owne, making it <hi>onus ſervile,</hi> that becauſe wee deale ſo, wee are worthie a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times to bee the children of death. And this is one firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that might move us.</item>
                           <item>2. The ſecond is the greatneſſe of the <hi>permiſsion</hi> of GOD: of theſe dayes, one is permitted to thee, to doe as that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. of all ſhalt thou eate: there is not a neceſſitie. Though one thing bee handled in divers Commandements, as <hi>prayer</hi> was handled in the firſt Commandement, as a part of <hi>inward</hi> worſhip in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as a part of <hi>outward</hi> worſhip in the third, as a <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of the <hi>lippes:</hi> and heere as it is an <hi>exerciſe</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Where in there is an <hi>vneven proportion:</hi> Hee hath but <hi>one</hi> to our <hi>ſix.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the ſeventh day to that <hi>one.</hi> So that the vice of idleneſſe of forbearing of worke is forbidden in the eight Commandement: and ſo doeth <hi>Paul</hi> put it <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. to <hi>ſtealing</hi> is <hi>oppoſed pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full working.</hi> So then this liberall permiſſion of GOD, wherein there is ſuch an <hi>vnequall</hi> and <hi>vneven proportion;</hi> if it bee broken, wee are to bee charged of great wickedneſſe.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>That that followeth, <hi>(And doe all thy worke,)</hi> The meaning of it is this, that indeede GOD might have dealt with us, as before, hee might have made all our <hi>life,</hi> to bee beſtowed on muſing of his will: but hee is content to forbeare us, and to ſpare us the reſt of the weeke: that in thoſe dayes all our buſineſſe might bee diſpatched, and none to bee done on <hi>His</hi> day. As <hi>Nathan</hi> ſaid to <hi>David, So much have I given thee, and more would I have done, if this
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:48000:174"/>had not beene ſufficient:</hi> ſo certaine it is, hee ſaw in his wiſdome that this was ſufficient; Therefore, hee willeth us to <hi>remember:</hi> when it is a comming, that wee may ende all, according as the thing ſanctified requireth.</p>
                        <p>Then, in the tenth <hi>Verſe,</hi> there followeth another oppoſition, which comprehendeth a ſecond reaſon; <hi>But the ſeventh day is the Sabbath of the LORD,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>idest,</hi> If as GOD hath permitted you ſixe dayes, ſo likewiſe Hee had made the ſeventh day yours to; then in it yee might have done, as in the other: but now hath hee reſerved this ſeventh day from you, and hath kept it to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and therefore, you cannot without open ſtealth breake up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this day to doe your worke, wherein you have no manner of right: as much as if a man ſhould ſay, You may weare that which you have bought; but this that I have bought with mine owne money, you cannot without violent injurie plucke it from mee. So becauſe his dealing is liberall, you cannot without manifeſt injurie to GOD, take it away from him. And becauſe this is his, hee will keepe it, and wholly to himſelfe. Therefore, is it that followeth; <hi>In it thou ſhalt doe no manner of worke.</hi> This for the firſt part of the tenth <hi>Verſe.</hi>
                        </p>

                           <hi>Auguſtine</hi> on <hi>Geneſis,</hi> intreating of the Creation, ſaith, That it is true, that it might have pleaſed God to have ſaid, <hi>Fiat totus Mundus,</hi> let all the World bee made in one moment; as <hi>Fiat lux,</hi> let there be light: in the firſt it had beene all one to his Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie, to have made it as well in a moment, as in ſix dayes: his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition is, What then ſhould move God? and hee findeth no reaſon but this, that men might proceed in the muſing of, and meditation of the Creation in the ſame order that God hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the Creation; elſe they ſhould have been in a maze. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>David</hi> when he entreth a diſcourſe of the Works of God, he uſeth an order: and <hi>Baſil</hi> and <hi>Ambroſe</hi> have written bookes of it; that men might begin to thinke, and give themſelves to neceſſary thoughts, and wholeſome cogitations. And this is thought to be the courſe that was in the Primitive Church.</p>
                        <p>For the ſubſtance of the reaſon it ſelfe, generally to move all, to doe as God hath done; nothing moveth a man ſo, as a nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble example: as Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 13.16. <hi>Exemplum dedi vobis, I have given you an example.</hi> When he ſaw his Diſciples given to pride, and would have them brought to Humility; What way taketh he? He taketh up a baſon of water, and a towell, and putting off his upper garment, waſheth their feet: and when he had done, <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. he ſaith, <hi>Wott yee what I have done? Exemplum dedi vobis, Yee call me Lord, and ye doe well, for I am ſo. If I that am your Lord waſh
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:48000:175"/>your feet how much more ought you to waſh one anothers feet.</hi> And in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. <hi>Paul</hi> propoundeth a marveilous example: <hi>Be yee followers of me, as I am of Chriſt.</hi> And therefore he himſelfe may doe that I have done my ſelfe; and becauſe I that needed not, have reſted: therefore muſt thou reſt, that needeſt it.</p>
                        <p>The laſt reaſon of the three; <hi>Therefore the Lord bleſſed the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day:</hi> he did not onely reſt himſelfe, but he hath conſecrated it alſo; and beſides his example, hee hath annexed a ſolemne In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution: So that it ſhall be to us a <hi>Mercatura animae,</hi> the market day of our ſoule; both for amendment of the weeke that went before, and for a better life in the weeke to come. But this is not the reaſon: the force of the reaſon is in this, becauſe God hath bleſſed and hallowed it: therefore this is a marveilous ſtrange kinde of oppoſition. Seeing I have done it, ſee you doe not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me; but ſee yee ſubmit you ſelves to my ordinance; that is, God is reſiſted, if his Ordinance be reſiſted; and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. he that deſpiſeth his ordinance, deſpiſeth him: therefore that God hath hallowed, we muſt not pollute. We ſee then how farre this reſt is to be kept, and what is required to the ſanctification.</p>
                        <p>The ſubſtance of the fourth Commandement, conſiſteth eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in theſe two things,
<list>
                              <item>1. in the outward reſt of the body;</item>
                              <item>2. the other, the End, to Sanctifie it.</item>
                           </list>
                        </p>
                        <p>As before, we muſt <hi>Remember</hi> it both in the weeke before the day come; partly, becauſe then we are to yeeld account of the former dayes workes to God, <hi>In ſingultu &amp; ſcrupulo cordis,</hi> with ſorrow and trouble of heart: partly alſo, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ne quid operis rejiciatur in diem feſtum,</hi> that we put not off any buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe untill the Sabbath: and when it is come, as <hi>Gregorie</hi> 11. <hi>Mor.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> becauſe there are two things; the one, <hi>Aliorum exempla,</hi> the example of others will make us forget duely to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie it: The other, <hi>Ludorum &amp; ſpectaculorum ſtudia,</hi> the deſire we have after ſports and paſtimes; wee are therefore then the rather to ſanctifie it, for <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.13. <hi>Delicatum Domini Sabbatum,</hi> the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of the Lord, is a delicate thing. Becauſe theſe two therefore engender a forgetfulneſſe, we muſt both remember it aforehand, add then alſo when it commeth.</p>
                        <p>The thing that we are to remember, is a day of <hi>reſt;</hi> to ſanctifie it. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> in two words comprehendeth it well, <hi>Otium ſanctum,</hi> a Holy Reſt, or returning from labour. And if we aske, A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning from what labour? the words following ſhew from what workes. A Canon of the Church ſheweth it. <hi>Quod ante fieri po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terat, &amp; quod poſt fieri poterit,</hi> What might have beene done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and what may be done afterward, muſt be reſted from: And whatſoever is meant by the labours and works of the weeke dayes, that muſt be ceaſed from of us: on the contrary <hi>Ab eo quod nec ante fieri poterat, nec poſtea poterit, non eſt ita avertendum,</hi> that which could not be done before and that which cannot be done afterward may on that day be done by us. The reaſon why it muſt be thus; <hi>Aug. Epiſt.</hi> 157. <hi>ad Optatum:</hi> and <hi>Jerome</hi> upon <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20. con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:48000:176"/>that the diſtinction of the bodily reſt is for ſanctification: For out of <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3. they take this for a ground; that there is nothing but muſt have his time: and conſequently, that we appoint cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine times for our bodies, for repaſt, as of ſleepe, &amp;c. in which time we take ſuch order, as that we be not let by any thing; and as he ſaith there, the more ſerious a thing we are to deale with; the more we ſeeke that nothing be done with it, but that onely and wholly;<note place="margin">The cheifeſt care to be had of the ſoule, that nothing trouble it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his whole meditation: but to this end it is meet wee be even ſolitarie as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith.</note> and we thinke we take a good order in it ſo. So in the Law of Nature, there is a time for the ſoule, and the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame, for procuring holineſſe to it, for declaring ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe in it; and ſo conſequently, that wee are (becauſe it is a ſerious matter) to uſe no leſſe diligence in the caſes thereof, then that there may be no other thing to hinder us.</p>
                        <p>And it is a matter ſo plaine, that we ſee even the councell of <hi>Trent</hi> (taking order for keeping of holy dayes) hath ſet downe, <hi>Quae abhis qui humanarum occupationum negotio detinentur, omnino praeſtare non poſſent,</hi> that this body entermeddle not it ſelfe with worldly affaires. So many of the Fathers as write upon that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 46.10. <hi>Vacate &amp; videte quod ego ſum Dominus,</hi> be ſtill and know that I am God: ſhew by the courſe of wiſedome, the ſame that the Philoſophers require; that <hi>Poſtulandum ſeceſſum, ut me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius intendamus,</hi> a full Vacation from cares, that a mans head be not occupied with thoughts in worldly matters, but that his ſoule might wholly intend this day; and the body might be at command with the ſoule: therefore the forbidding of workes in this Commandement, is not therefore, becauſe the workes of themſelves are evill, but onely becauſe they would diſtract the minde; and would not ſuffer the whole man, wholly to intend the workes of the Sabbath. The ſubſtance of this Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I ſayd, conſiſteth of theſe two parts, <hi>Reſt,</hi> and <hi>Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The <hi>Reſt,</hi> is the firſt part, <hi>otium.</hi> It is a very ſtrange thing, that the nature of man is ſo altogether given to be contrary to Gods will and wiſedome; ſo that it falleth out on both ſides contrary. Where the precepts are laborious,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> and of travell and paine, there they will be idle: and where the precepts are not laborious, and of no paine, there, rather then they will not breake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, they will take paines, and wee will even againſt our natures, make our ſelves buſineſſe: and we will pick out that day of all dayes of the weeke, that he hath choſen: ſo that we make it a kind of pollicie, to make advantage of that day, and to find labour in that day, which hee hath denyed us to labour in. This for the eaſineſſe of the Commandement, and perverſeneſſe of man.</p>
                        <p>Concerning this reſt there are ſix <hi>Countermands.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The firſt thing that wee finde Countermanded here, is <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.26. there God taketh order in <hi>Elim,</hi> before the Law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that from their very neceſſary labour, from gathering <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> they ſhould ceaſe; the reaſon is, becauſe it is <hi>mercatura animae,</hi>
                           <pb n="339" facs="tcp:48000:176"/>the ſoules Market; there is a better thing then <hi>Manna, John</hi> 6.58. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. ſpeaking there of the heavenly food, of that day, doth preferre it before <hi>Manna.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p n="2">2. A ſecond forbidding in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.15. not onely the gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Manna,</hi> or the going out to gather; but though it bee brought us, yet a plaine countermand and execution upon it, ſheweth that it is unlawfull. So we are forbidden, as from ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering of <hi>Manna,</hi> ſo from buying of <hi>Manna.</hi> To this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth Buying and Selling; all Markets and Faires on that day forbidden.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. From <hi>carrying burthens, Jer.</hi> 17.21, 22. there is a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination againſt thoſe that carryed burthens on that day, that made it their carriage day, that hee would bring a plague upon them; and that ſuch as is there mentioned, that is, <hi>Captivity:</hi> So we muſt not carry on that day, except we will that God give us a burthen, that is, Captivitie.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. A fourth thing forbidden, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.21. becauſe this carriage and inninge of harveſt and grapes might ſeeme to be a matter of great neceſſity; therefore he ſaith, that both in Seed-time, and Harveſt, and Vintage, his Sabbaths ſhould be kept; that is, ſo as that the proviſion of the whole Common-wealth, muſt give place to the Reſt of the Lord. And that is for carriage.</p>
                        <p n="5">5. For journeying and travelling on the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.29. <hi>Cras erit Sabbathum Jehovae: maneat unuſquiſque in loco ſuo, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que egrediatur quiſpiam,</hi> to morrow is the reſt of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord, abide ye every man in his place, and let no man go out on the ſeventh day. Which is a great abuſe with us.</p>
                        <p n="6">6. In <hi>Exod.</hi> 31.13. there is a matter that goeth beyond all theſe; neither may the contrary courſe be taken: for there in the Chapters precedent, in the 28, 29, 30. God having ſet downe this platforme for the building up of his Tabernacle, and willed <hi>Moſes</hi> preſently to goe in hand with it, yet he ſaith in that thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth verſe, <hi>Notwithſtanding I will have my Sabbath kept:</hi> which is as much to ſay, that in that worke that might have beſt ſhew, and might ſeeme the beſt and lawfulleſt, and make moſt to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, yet he would have his Sabbath kept, and not broken for it; becauſe in other matters ye may refraine, in this ye may not: And ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. he taketh order for the univerſall day. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that doth any manner of worke, on the Sabbath day, is judged worthy of death: <hi>Nomanner of worke,</hi> the univerſall terme. And <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.35. it is executed upon one that brake the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.27. he there proteſteth for polluting the places of his reſt, that he will viſit them with a plague of fire, and ſuch a one, as ſhould burne up the Pallaces of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhould not be quenched. The Prophets are great urgers of this Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement above all other Commandements: and where this plague of fire is threatned, there goeth before, a prophaning of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: and we may obſerve that there hath not beene any ſtrange viſitation by fire, but ſome notable profanation of this day hath
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:48000:177"/>gone before; and it is uſuall among us alſo. So when it ſhall pleaſe God to viſit us with the like judgement, wee know where to have the cauſe of it: Therefore to conclude this place; thoſe that goe out to gather <hi>Manna,</hi> that carry <hi>burthens,</hi> that <hi>buy</hi> or <hi>ſell,</hi> that gather in <hi>harveſt</hi> or <hi>vintage,</hi> that <hi>journey</hi> and travell up and downe, and to ſpeake as it is <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. generally; let not them thinke, it is <hi>otium,</hi> or <hi>Sabbatum Jebovae:</hi> that it is the keeping of the Sabbath. <hi>Auguſline</hi> 3. <hi>Serm. de quadrageſ. non ſabbathum Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini eſt, ſed ſabbatum Tyri:</hi> The 37. Canon of the councell of <hi>Ments, tempore Caroli:</hi> The 35. Canon of the firſt councell of <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buria.</hi> The 1. Canon of the ſecond councell of <hi>Maſcon;</hi> injoyne a holy obſervation of this day: In the 37. Canon of <hi>Ments,</hi> there is a deprivation of the Communion for three yeares, againſt that party that goeth to pleade cauſes, or keepe Markets (belike it was their cuſtome in thoſe dayes to pleade cauſes on the Sabbath) So in the councell of <hi>Triburia,</hi> the like order was taken; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe <hi>Concil: matiſconenſe;</hi> it was larger for the fault, milder for the puniſhment; for it was but for halfe a yeare. And (as one ſaith) God commanded the reſt, not for the reſt it ſelfe, but onely <hi>Quia toto die hoc Deo tantummodo vacandum:</hi> and to give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver himſelfe body and ſoule to God.</p>
                        <p>Here then falleth in the <hi>queſtion</hi> concerning the ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sabbath,<note place="margin">

                              </gap>l.</note> as to every Commandement, there were ceremonies: Two, the one for not dreſſing their meate; the other, for not building their fire on the Sabbath day, <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.3. which are both ceremoniall. The reaſon, for there is no externall duty of the Law, but it may be performed of any man, of any Nation throughout the World. But it is well knowne, that thoſe that are under the <hi>Poles,</hi> they cannot live one day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fire; and to let their fire goe out, it were the utter deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them all: and therefore becauſe it is ſuch an externall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is certaine it is not morall. The like may be ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proviſion of meate; for they that are under the hot <hi>Zone,</hi> under the <hi>Equinoctiall,</hi> their proviſion will not laſt them but one day; therefore theſe Acts cannot be kept in the whole World; therefore ceremoniall. So the Chriſtian is releaſed, not but that they could be performed of the <hi>Jewes;</hi> and therefore a peculiar precept to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> becauſe they had no hinderances.</p>
                        <p>To make yet a further <hi>queſtion.</hi>
                           <note place="margin">
                              <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2.</note> Whether all thoſe ſix reſts are abſolutely to be holden or not; and whether on the Sabbath, all of thoſe before mentioned, as to gather <hi>Manna,</hi> to <hi>travell,</hi> &amp;c. be ſimply unlawfull<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We anſwer to this, No: no further then the precept <hi>Eth haſſhabbath, &amp;c.</hi> for that our reſt muſt be a ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication: the outward reſt is <hi>Deſtinatum ſanctificationi: ideo qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcimus, ut ſanctificemus.</hi> So whereas our <hi>quies</hi> is not <hi>deſtinata ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationi,</hi> where the ſanctification can be <hi>cum quiete,</hi> with Reſt; there it is lawfull; where it cannot bee, there it is unlawfull.
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:48000:177"/>Certaine it is, that a man may reſt, and not ſanctifie; and ſo he may ſanctifie, and not reſt: and therefore it is ſaid, there are many <hi>reſters,</hi> and few <hi>ſanctifiers.</hi> In theſe caſes the ſanctification ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thus, either upon the meanes of our ſanctification; or elſe in the declaring of our ſanctification; that is, in the practice of it. Whereas a mans reſt cannot agree with both theſe; the reſt, becauſe it is not deſtinated to them, may be left; the reſt being a ſubordinate end. And the rule is, in Logick: <hi>Tantum deſtinati ſumendum eſt, quantum ad finem prodeſt,</hi> ſo much of any thing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed is to be taken, as conduces to the end wherefore it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; as if you will take a purge, you muſt take ſo much as will ſerve to purge; and where his end riſeth, there muſt alſo the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate ariſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. for the meanes of ſanctification, Chriſt defending his Diſciples againſt the Jewes, which indeed were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together urgers of the bodily reſt, he ſheweth that the reſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the ſanctification, may be broken; as of the Prieſts in ſacrificing; and indeed it is the moſt laborious time for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter; but hereby they are blameleſſe, becauſe they are <hi>in opere cultus Domini,</hi> exerciſed about divine worſhip. And ſo ſhall you reade, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.12. mention made of a Sabbath dayes journey; out of 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.23. for there the <hi>Shunamite</hi> comming to het huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band for her Aſſe, he ſaith to her, Why ſhould you goe to him to day? it is neither the Sabbath day, nor the new Moone. The meaning is this, that the <hi>Shunamite</hi> was wont to goe out to heare the Prophet; and becauſe ſhe had not meanes, ſhee would ride forth: Therefore where the meanes of ſanctification are wanting, a man may take a ſabbath dayes journey; he may goe where they are uſed to be gotten: Thus for the firſt part of ſanctification. Now of this firſt part of ſanctification, the meanes is leſſe accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God; then the ſecond part thereof, which is the practice of the worke of ſanctification: For Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.9. out of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.6. when as he was there reproved for a worke of healing, he defends himſelfe, and biddeth them goe and learne, what that ſaying meant, <hi>I will have mercy and not ſacrifice.</hi> Mercy being here indeed a worke of ſanctification, is preferred before the meanes. So in regard of the practice of ſanctification to ſhew a worke of mercy, a man may leave the very meanes of ſanctification; for if in Sermon time, there ſhould happen a fire, or man or woman ſounding or travelling; the meanes may be left, becauſe by this meanes they ſhew a worke of mercy, ſaving thoſe which ſhould have periſhed: therefore this is the thing that maketh that for the ſecond part, the bodily reſt may be omitted.</p>
                        <p>It ſhall be convenient to conſider this point, that as God is glorified in his Creation, and the memory of this from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the cauſe of this Inſtitution; ſo hath he glory in the preſervation of his creatures: and ſo conſequently by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of them. As <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.12. Chriſt bids the fragments to be taken up; his reaſon, that nothing be loſt: and if the leaſt things may not be loſt, much leſſe the life of any thing; much leſſe mau
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:48000:178"/>or the life of man. And wee ſee for mans life, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.13. and for beaſts that ſerve man, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.15. that hee will have workes of Mercie practiſed on the <hi>Sabbath</hi> day, as <hi>contra,</hi> for other perill, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.11. and 13. But wee muſt with all underſtand this, that thoſe caſes of ſhewing mercie, muſt bee onely <hi>praeſente neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate,</hi> and not <hi>impellente,</hi> or <hi>imminente neceſsitate.</hi> When any <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> danger is offered to my life, I am to defend my ſelfe, and ſave my ſelfe, without the helpe of the Magiſtrate; yea, even with the the taking away of the life of the other: in <hi>caſu praeſentis neceſsita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, quiſque magistratus est, &amp; perſonam DEI gerit, vt occidat po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius quam occidatur.</hi> But if the perill bee not preſent, but <hi>immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,</hi> as if it bee tolde me I am way laid, &amp;c. I may not take the matter into my handes; but looke to the Magiſtrate; ſo for the <hi>preſent</hi> perill, or neceſſitie, there is <hi>exemption,</hi> and the LORD hath given his right into our handes: but not for <hi>imminent</hi> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill. And on the other ſide, wee muſt marke another thing: that becauſe wee have to deale with GOD, who ſearcheth the <hi>heart,</hi> though happily men bee borne in hand, that it was a preſent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitie, and could not bee prevented, nor differred, whereas before hand, wee might have either prevented or differred it, it muſt bee ſo, that wee bee able to juſtifie our <hi>hearts</hi> in GODS eyes: but that wee have beene carefull and laboured by all meanes poſſible to prevent that buſineſſe: and could not have prevented nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it, but that wee were overtaken with preſent <hi>neceſsitie.</hi> Elſe it is no neceſſitie; but we draw it unto us with coards.</p>
                        <p>For this ende, tell them abroad, touching their working in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, on the <hi>Sabbath,</hi> by what authority they doe theſe thinges? preſently they will have their anſwer, that it is not GODS will, that any of his creatures ſhould periſh. And it is true. And therefore, that which they doe, is onely for the preſerving of the creatures, and not for their gaine. Therefore, for this caſe a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſo</hi> muſt bee had; and there was a good <hi>proviſo</hi> in the Canonicall Church made for it: that becauſe they ſhould make a diſtinction betwixt the workes of that day and other, as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2.

That GOD might bee <hi>ſanctified: id est,</hi> That hee might bee <hi>magnified. Exod.</hi> 31.13. The Sabbath was a Signe betwixt GOD and us; whereby wee may know that it is hee that ſanctifieth us. So when this is wrought, wee might bring forth <hi>fruite</hi> of this ſanctification. Whereas GOD, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.3. did firſt make holy this Day, out of the proportion of it, <hi>John.</hi> 17.19. hee <hi>ſanctified</hi> it for <hi>our</hi> ſakes, and not for <hi>his</hi> owne: and his ſanctification was, as it is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 1.5. The <hi>ordaining</hi> of it to an <hi>holy uſe,</hi> and that as <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.3. appointed by a <hi>ſeparation</hi> to that exerciſe, from other dayes; and then as 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. by giving <hi>a bleſsing</hi> to the exerciſe, that is upon that day: And that that was his, to make holy; is our dutie to keepe holy: For if a thing bee <hi>destinated</hi> to an uſe, and bee <hi>not applied</hi> to it, it is <hi>perverted.</hi> See <hi>Ezechias</hi> his courſe, 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.5.
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48000:179"/>whatſoever God hath ſanctified or made holy, that the fruite thereof may redound to us; it needs not that we ſhould ſanctifie the thing, but we muſt firſt ſanctifie our ſelves. We cannot make it holy, but keepe it holy; as the deſtination is of God, ſo the application is of our ſelves; but <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.29. what thing ſoever is holy, he muſt ſee he be holy that toucheth it: So he that liveth in that day, that he doe not touch it, nor looke upon the Sunne that ſhineth in it, but that hee be able to make it, and himſelfe holy: all that looke on the ſunne that day muſt be holy.</p>
                        <p>For the uſe of the meanes. For this cauſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.16. it is plaine, that we are ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt: And there is therein a reſemblance to (<hi>Levit.</hi> 8.10.) the Leviticall ſanctifying: There was nothing could be ſanctified, but it muſt firſt be annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.27. it is ſaid, to be as the figure of the ſpirituall Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; which is nothing elſe but the ſpirituall working of the Holy Ghoſt in our hearts. So then firſt we muſt ſee that the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction be in us, then (as before) <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. becauſe the Holy Ghoſt which onely can ſanctifie us, is the gift of God, and is not denyed to any, to whom hee hath given grace to receive it; the ſpirit expreſſeth it in this manner, and compareth himſelfe to fire, the ſparke is given by God; ſo that the matter muſt be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and prepared by us, that wee (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19.) doe not quench the ſpirit, that is, Propheſies, or the ordinary meanes which God hath ordained. <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.8. That ſanctification ſhall not come to any man by his owne braine, by doing that which is good in his owne eyes; but onely the preſcript method that God hath ſet downe for the gathering of Matter for this Sparke; which the Holy Ghoſt muſt ſet on fire; that ſo it might not goe out. The Fathers in the Councell of <hi>Gangara,</hi> laſt Canon, have ſet it downe thus; That if any man keeping his houſe that day, be never ſo fruitfully occupied, and thinke he pleaſeth God, they give him <hi>Anathema</hi> for it, eſpecially at thoſe times.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>meanes</hi> of ſanctification. In which nothing elſe can be ſaid, but that was ſaid before in knowledge; how the true knowledge might be come by. Onely that that <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, of the often iteration: that this is the fruit of iteration, that he that ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth may ſay, <hi>Domine ſcis, quia dixi, Domine ſcis, quia iteravi, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine ſcis, quia conteſtatus ſum,</hi> Lord thou knoweſt I have ſanctified thy Name becauſe I have preacht thy Name, I have talked of it againe and againe, I have beene witneſſe unto thy truth. In 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.4. the Apoſtle attributeth the ſanctification of every thing to Prayer that is uſed before: and therefore they have termed it, the Preparative to all the duties of a Chriſtian: More plainely, <hi>Mar.</hi> 1.35. Chriſt in the morning before day, aroſe and prayed ſo long, and came into the Synagogue; which may neceſſarily be gathered to be the Sabbath day. Then we ſee here Chriſt, for the meanes of ſanctification tooke order, firſt beginning with Prayer: For the exerciſe thereof, that is, Prayer; it hath two parts, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is before, or after. Before, either private, as of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:48000:180"/>
                           <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.1. and <hi>Mark</hi> 6.46. of Chriſt: Or publick, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.13. that even the Heathen themſelves went out to pray at the rivers ſide: But eſpecially by 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. that to the prayers of the Congregation every one ſhould joyne his owne Amen. And ſecondly, After, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.24. becauſe, as before we be not fit to receive, ſo after wee have received unleſſe God cover his ſpirit which he hath given unto us, the enemie will ſeeke power againſt us to take it away (as <hi>Luke</hi> 8.12.) except we deſire the Lord, that his word may remaine with us ſtill, and bring forth his worke.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. After that ſucceedeth the uſe of the word: that is ſanctified for ſanctification. <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.21. more plainely, <hi>Deut.</hi> 4.10. <hi>Gather me the people together,</hi> (for this end) <hi>and I will cauſe them to heare my words:</hi> Therefore the end is, <hi>to heare the word.</hi> The word in that day, hath a double uſe: Firſt, as it is read or heard, read onely: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as it is Preached, or heard preached.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. The firſt; the Church in great wiſedome alwayes thought beſt and moſt neceſſary, that it ſhould goe before, that men might not be eſtranged, when the word was read; that the other ſhould not be ſtrange to them. But it is a ſtrange thing, that we at the hearing thinke we have done enough, if wee can apprehend it; whereas if before we would meditate well of it, when it is reade, wee might make better uſe of it: and at the hearing afterward, might be confirmed in the ſame.</p>
                        <p>The ordinary courſe and time of reading the Scriptures, among the Jewes was their <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, <hi>the preparation to the Sabbath;</hi> at the ninth houre, at rhree of the clock: and was told them before, that they might be acquainted with it the better.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. To come to the publick reading in the congregation; it is warranted by <hi>Acts</hi> 13.17. and 15.21. by the Goſpell, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.27. <hi>I charge you that this Epiſtle bee reade to all the Brethren the Saints.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Then for <hi>private reading,</hi> after the congregation is broken up, becauſe Chriſt ſheweth plainely that his witneſſes be the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore will have the Scriptures to be ſearched, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Prophecies of him: and <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.20. for <hi>threatning;</hi> and <hi>Eſay</hi> 34.16. <hi>Seeke in the booke of the Lord, and reade, none of all theſe things ſhall faile, none ſhall want her mate; for his mouth hath commanded, and his very ſpirit hath gathered them.</hi> And for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of that that is taught, <hi>Revel.</hi> 3. a practiſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. for the acquainting of the <hi>Berreans</hi> to examine the Apoſtles doctrine.</p>
                        <p>There are two more uſes in reading, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.3. There is a bleſſing pronounced to them that reade, or heare the words of the Prophecie, becauſe it exciteth men to praiſe God: Men ſeeing the Prophecies fulfilled and executed, they may not doubt, but conſent to God: For which cauſe theſe were monuments of the Church, of the fulfilling of any promiſe or threatning; yea they ſuffered in the old Church, the Monuments of the Warres of God, for the <hi>Iſraelites, Num.</hi> 21.14. their <hi>liber bellorum Dei,</hi> and
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:48000:180"/>their <hi>verba dierum,</hi> of <hi>Nathan, Gad, Shemajah,</hi> &amp;c. they ſuffered them privately in an holy uſe to be read, that ſeeing his promiſes with the denouncing of his threatnings, they might be excited to the greater praiſe and feare of God.</p>
                        <p>Another uſe is, as they gather by the Analogie of <hi>Daniel</hi> 2.2. and <hi>Acts</hi> 8.28. <hi>Daniel</hi> was occupied in the expoſition of the Prophet <hi>Jeremie;</hi> ſo the Evnuch reading <hi>Eſay,</hi> asked the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of it of <hi>Philip:</hi> and no doubt, if <hi>Philip</hi> had written on that day, he might have had uſe of his writing, as of Preaching. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God hath ordained Expoſitors, ſuch as the booke of <hi>Iaſher, Ioſ.</hi> 10.13. a commentor of the Law: his workes being for this end, to make knowne the hard texts of Scripture, and expound them unto us.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond part in the meanes of ſanctification, is the Word preached; that is it that <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.15. the Apoſtle ſpeakes of,<note place="margin">For Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> which is <hi>the ordinary meanes of Faith;</hi> and Chriſt in his Prayer, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.17. <hi>Sanctifie them in thy truth: and thy word is truth.</hi> Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.16. by his Preaching hath ſanctified it: and the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. hath pronounced, not to receive any other alteration to the Worlds end.</p>
                        <p n="3">3. The third followeth, the pondering of that that wee have heard read or preached; as <hi>Luke</hi> 2.19. according to the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>O how love I thy Law;</hi> it is my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation continually; the occupying of our mindes and meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to apply it hereafter, and make fruit of it. Beſide the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the word, that wee ſhall heare read, or preached; the 92. <hi>Pſalme</hi> (which was a Pſalme made for the Sabbath, and is ſung as on that day; and if credit may be given to the Jewes traditions, they tell us, that the two firſt verſes came from <hi>Adam,</hi> and hee uſed to ſing them in Paradiſe:) giveth three further points to conſider. Firſt, <hi>verſ.</hi> 4. which is indeed that which God here urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the conſideration of the workes of his hands, the making to our ſelves a contemplative uſe, as we have made all the week long an active of them; ſo wee ſhould have a ſpirituall. And the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. a meditation of the judgements of God: The third is, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. and 12. a meditation of the mercies of God; of the mercies and viſitations; taking judgements, for the <hi>genus</hi> to both. Theſe, whether they extend to our owne perſons, or come on our Fathers houſe, or the place wherein we live, or the Church round about us, there is none of theſe, but they afford us an object of meditation; and as we ſee the meditation of the creatures of God, of the wild Aſſes, Sparrow, Crane, Lillies, &amp;c. they yeeld ſtill meditation from tha leſſe to the greater; if they be thus thankfull, how much more are wee bound to him? So <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. he ſets downe his judgements to move us to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and his mercy to move us to thankfulneſſe; and thus, when we are wearied with prayer, and reading, and preaching is ceaſed, our meditation remaineth to continue the whole day and ſtil find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth matter to worke upon.</p>
                        <pb n="348" facs="tcp:48000:181"/>
                        <p n="4">4. The fourth; Which is not a beating within our ſelves in our counting houſe, of any great calamitie; but the examining of it betwixt us and others; and that is done three manner of wayes.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. With them that have taught us; as <hi>Luke</hi> 2.42. it appeareth plainly, that after the ſolemnitie in the eight day, the laſt of the feaſt, it was the manner, the <hi>teachers</hi> ſate them downe at the Table, and the <hi>Auditors</hi> propounded <hi>Doubts</hi> and <hi>Questions,</hi> to bee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of them.

There is a charge to <hi>Aaron;</hi> that whenſoever they came to appeare before the LORD, none of them ſhould appeare <hi>emptie.</hi> Therefore, <hi>Levit.</hi> 8.31. There is mention made of a <hi>Basket</hi> of <hi>ſanctification;</hi> in which were reſerved thoſe thinges, that afterward they would conſecrate to the LORD.

                        <p>The workes are either <hi>outward,</hi> and performed to the bodie; or <hi>inward,</hi> and performed to the ſpirit of man. For the firſt <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. our Saviour certainlie as hee is CHRIST, when hee ſhall come to judge, it ſhall be happie for ſix works that he there recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth; and the ſeventh may be added: three in <hi>Verſe</hi> 35. firſt, the feeding the hungrie: ſecond, giving drinke to the thirſtie: third, the mercifull dealing with, or good entertayning of the ſtranger. And three in <hi>Verſe</hi> 36. firſt, cloathing the naked: ſecond, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſicke: third, ſuccouring them that bee in priſon.

                           <hi>Augustine, lib. de cura pro mortuis,</hi> giveth this reaſon, that this care of the dead, is a worke of mercie.

                        <p>In this duty of faſting, if we reſpect the puniſhment onely, or the viſitation of God, no doubt it is hard to make it Statarie; at a ſet time, a prefixed day; neither hath the Lord appointed ſo for that <hi>Jom appormi,</hi> a day of expiation, <hi>Expiare peccata ſua jeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio,</hi> and ſo conſequently it hindreth not, but that there may be ſet dayes, and a ſet faſt: and it is more expedient it ſhould.</p>

And that we ſhould be without that too; but onely for the commandement of God, for nakedneſſe.

And as we are forbidden and reſtrained all theſe; ſo <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.28. are we forbidden any labour, or worke of the ſix dayes: and ſo falleth in, that the ſame reſt is required then, as on the Sabbath.</p>
                        <p>Laſt of all, as we finde, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.10. the precept, an example, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.3. the Centurions faſting, that it was joyned with almes: <hi>Canon. Quod ventri ſubtrahitar, illud pauperi addatur,</hi> that which we ſpare out of our owne bellies, muſt be given to the poore.</p>
                        <p>But now, becauſe as we ſaid before, it is not bodily labour, or bodily reſt, (ſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. the Kingdome of God is not in meate and drinke:) If there we ſtay and goe no further, it will not ſerve: Therefore the Prophet telleth ſuch faſters, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.3. though they lay in ſackcloth a whole day, yet it was not that God required; becauſe the outward action is but ordained for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, the account that God maketh is of that; it is inſtituted for humbling; <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.13. what is there ſaid of Sacrifice, may be ſaid as well of outward mourning: And as it is, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. not the rending of apparrell, but the heart: and the faſt that he allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth off, muſt be accordingly. And 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.11. where the Apoſtle deſcribeth the full courſe of whatſoever is required of us inwardly in this faſt. And <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. it muſt come from the ſpirit, with ſuch ſighings, as cannot be expreſſed.</p>
                        <p>Of the <hi>ſorrow,</hi> there cannot be an exquiſite method; but as he
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:48000:185"/>ſetteth them downe there, they are in two companies: either a working of ſeare, and conſequently a <hi>ſorrow:</hi> and after that, a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that we have been ſo unkinde to offend ſo mercifull a Father; and then after that we have a while remained, that we proceed to a deſire of amends, and that we be carefull: and that care ſheweth it ſelfe zealous; and if we chance not to proceed a right, then that we be ready to puniſh our ſelves. In a word, the fruit of thoſe actions, they tend to this end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. that we may judge our ſelves, that ſo we may eſcape: As his policie was, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.31. and as we ſee the common practiſe of the rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, if by any meanes he may make the bowels of his Prince to yearne within him: But alwayes except the ſeale of humiliation and faſting be added, all is naught. <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.1. and laſt. Where after a great vow before the Congregation, proteſted that after an exhortation foure times; and after a ſolemne reading of the Law at that time: When as ordinarie readings was but twice. This was the order for the furtherance of this: and when hee had drawne a Covenant, they ſet their hands and ſeales to it, and ſo bound themſelves by an everlaſting Covenant. Which vow if wee can keepe, if we can bring our ſelves to the vow of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; if we can doe this unfainedly, and doe it ſo effectually, as we promiſe readily, ever afterward; it is very certaine that this hath taken a good root in us.</p>
                        <p>The fourth rule. The ſpirituall part of the Law. Which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Eſay</hi> knew the value of it in the Faſt; as <hi>Cha.</hi> 58.3. and in his Sabbath, at the 13. <hi>verſe</hi> of the ſame, nothing did ſo belong to them, as if they would give over their owne corrupt Will: if mans corrupt will could be brought under: This is that he ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Sanctifie the Lord your God in your hearts;</hi> It is a thing that may be performed of man; and ſuch as the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth greatly in.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>meanes</hi> in which the lord throughout the Scriptures com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehendeth theſe: that whereas there muſt be a ſolemne proſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thankefulneſſe, and our ſorrow for our unthankefulneſſe there muſt be a place alſo, and perſons chiefe in theſe actions of Sanctification: And theſe perſons, not <hi>Ex tumultuario grege,</hi> they muſt not be men of the common rout; but ſuch as muſt be trayned up for it. And becauſe the trayning up will require coſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the order for the maintenance of the Miniſters, and the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities, which are the places to prepare them for Miniſters, and Schooles, they are commanded alike of God.</p>
                        <p>For the <hi>place, Leviticus</hi> 19.30. and 26.2. in both places, is this ſentence: <hi>Yee ſhall keepe my Sabbaths, and reverence my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie:</hi> making the obſervation of his day, and reverence of the place to runne in one verſe; and making them of one na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                        <p>The Sabbath is the day of reſt, and when we hallow it, we call
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48000:185"/>it the <hi>Lords reſt;</hi> ſo <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 132.14. we ſee the Lord will give the ſame name to the place. <hi>This is my reſt:</hi> Concerning which, as the Apoſtles tooke order, as that the exteriour part of GODS worſhip might be performed decently and in order. So on the other ſide, that the place of GODS worſhip ſhould bee ſo homely, and ſo ordered, that the Table of the Lords Supper, where (one ſaith well) <hi>Tremenda Dei myſteria,</hi> the dreadfull my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of GOD are celebrated, that it were fitter to eate Oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at, to be an Oyſter table, then to ſtand in the Sanctuary of the LORD, this is ſo farre from <hi>Pompa,</hi> that it is farre from <gap reason="foreign">

As our working, travelling, &amp;c. ſhew that we eſteeme not that day; ſo the Walls and Windowes ſhew, that we are not eſteemers of his Sanctuary.</p>
                        <p>From the <hi>place,</hi> to the <hi>Perſon</hi> (the Miniſter.) Concerning which perſon likewiſe we know, that GOD hath appointed him to be the chiefe dealer to ſtand betwixt Him and Man, <hi>Tanquam pater patratus,</hi> and ſo farre forth excellent in their owne natures are the Miniſters of GOD, that are his Embaſſadours not to the people, <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, but to the higheſt Princes upon earth; yet it falleth out with them, as with the Day and Place: they are diſeſteemed and neglected. In the old time, wicked Princes thought meanely of the Miniſters, as they to whom it pertained, as they thought then but to burne a little Incenſe; and the Prieſts office to be nothing elſe, but to offer Sacrifice. So now moſt thinke that it is nothing elſe, but the reading of certaine prayers, and going up into the Pulpit of Wood, and ſpeaking there an houre, without ſenſe and reaſon; yea, many times, without any reverence: In this reſpect GOD hath taken order, that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.11. and <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. there he ſheweth, that it is not that alone; that he ſhall ſet <hi>Jacob</hi> to ſchoole, and learne <hi>Iſrael</hi> his leſſon: but he ſhall teach the King alſo, even <hi>Joſhuah</hi> the Prince, and at his bidding he ſhall goe out and come in.</p>
                        <p>It is not a thing that pertaineth ſo much to the outward cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration; but the workes of ſanctification: and ſo conſequently, that is not wrought by ſtatutes of Princes, but by the Lords Law. But the Counſellor at the Lords Law muſt bee eſteemed. If a Prince be but onely (as the Heathen man ſaith) <hi>Tanquam ſubul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> or like an Heardman that keepeth heards, and looketh that one beguile not another, and have no charge of the ſoule: there were ſomewhat that might be ſaid. But it is otherwiſe; and ſo conſequently as he muſt looke over the ſoule; and the ſoule is a chiefe part, and requireth a chiefe care: and the chiefe care re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth ſuch, as be fit to be <hi>Doctores gentium;</hi> that is, to teach whole Countries. And againe, if it were our outward and bodily
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:48000:186"/>enemies, that fought againſt us, as <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Frenchmen:</hi> ſomewhat it were, that the caſes might be ſo. But ſeeing, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.12. it is a ſpirituall combate with ſpirituall enemies, with <gap reason="foreign">

Therefore it ſhould be better maintained, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 24.17. the Holy Ghoſt ſheweth there plainely, that the life of <hi>Jehoiadah</hi> the Prieſt, and his wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, was the meanes that kept the King from Idolatry, and conſequently from deſtruction. In <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 82.5. there is a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall uſe, he ſheweth that the want of knowledge is it, that bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the foundations of the earth, all the Lawes, out of courſe. In a defect of all ſtatutes, the maintenance of knowledge, is that, that would, <hi>Servare Legem â fraude,</hi> keepe the Lawes; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.18. the wiſe man and the wiſe King ſaith, that that did <hi>Servare gregem ab interitu.</hi> That which did keepe the people from periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is <hi>Prophetia,</hi> the carefull looking to Prophecie. For if a man doe but looke into the eſtates of mighty Common-wealths, whoſe wiſedome and policie hath beene great, yet wee ſee that Ryot and the ſinne of Gluttony, and diſeaſed bodies, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; and on the other ſide, Adulterie, baſtard-ſlips, and laſt Tranſlation of Inheritances; theſe were the decay of the <hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> Monarchie.</p>
                        <p>Againe, looke into the <hi>Perſian</hi> Empire, Idleneſſe, neglect of Tillage, and of Mechanicall Arts, and Merchandiſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by every man growing to be <hi>Patricius,</hi> a Gentleman; they were the ruine of that Empire. And the <hi>Greekes</hi> had never the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw, till then that Covetouſneſſe got footing among them, and ſo needleſſe dearth; and that the greater men begunne to vexe the inferiour, and the Prince to burthen his Subjects. So the <hi>Romans,</hi> by their owne Pride, Envy, Emulations, Heartburn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Seditions, were brought downe. And thus was it with all thoſe Monarchies, for thoſe vices, which GODS Law would not have ſuffered; and it is not poſſible by other Lawes to amend them.</p>
                        <p>To come to our owne; in the time of <hi>Brittains</hi> often injuries, and a bringing in of delayes of Suites, and making of Lawes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the Fine; the Lawyers they were deſirous to maintaine Cauſes and Suites, onely for the Fee.

                           </list> Whereas in conjunction we muſt rather love the faithfull, our countreymen and kinsfolke; here, in the caſe of excellencie it is not ſo. For ſometimes wee muſt give more honour to an infidell: as <hi>Acts</hi> 25. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Nero,</hi> and <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.3. to a ſtranger, as they did to <hi>Daniel:</hi> and <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.40. as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did to <hi>Ioſeph.</hi> And to give this to men indued with gifts, is in regard of their neareneſſe to God: for by his benefits they are neerer his end: ſo, as for this cauſe they are to be preferred, and made nearer to us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo.

                        <p>Gods wiſdome wonderfully appeareth in this; For ſeeing <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.18. the occaſion of the Woman was, that ſhe ſhould <hi>helpe:</hi> becauſe that though it were good, yet not the <hi>beſt,</hi> that Man ſhould be <hi>alone:</hi> for he being <hi>finite,</hi> and therefore of a finite power, might with <hi>helpe</hi> performe better ſervices unto God.

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48000:202"/>did <hi>Jacob</hi> prophecie of <hi>Iſſacar, Gen.</hi> 49.14. that he ſhould have this <hi>Depreſsionem imellectus,</hi> this darkneſſe of underſtanding; as alſo God hath ſhewed, in making the body ſit to beare, rather then to governe. So we ſee how naturall ſervitude and ſervice came in.</p>
                        <p>Then, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.38. and 10.18. after, this plague of God (though it were under all) began firſt to bring men under ſubjection: ſo that <hi>Nimrod</hi> and his crue, oppreſſeth the Kings of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the <hi>Pentapolis</hi> about them. <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.4. And thus came <hi>Servitus ex ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitate.</hi> ſervitude forc't through neceſſity: <hi>Neceſsitas enim dat legem legi.</hi> From this neceſſity came <hi>ſervus pacti,</hi> a ſervant by Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; for men would willingly make a covenant, and bind them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they might be free from thoſe their oppreſſors. And hence it was that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſo many ſervants, as the <hi>Jewes</hi> note, 318. Becauſe they ſeeing his equity, were glad to be with him. And <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.29. it turned to their great good, receiving thereby <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> the freedome of their ſoules; and for this cauſe, none of <hi>Iſrael</hi> might be ſervant, for God by their ſervice, might gaine the more of the Heathen. Yet after, other reſpects drew e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Saints of God to be ſervants. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.29. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſerved <hi>Laban</hi> twenty yeares; ſo that in this reſpect, where poverty is, that a man may be made rich; Where ignorance is, that a man may learne knowledge; he may be ſervant, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.12. (And thus came this ſervice, by Gods goodneſſe; turning the puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a bleſſing to his. So that when we can have no freedome, it is generally for all, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.17. and particularly for every one, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. and 21. to abide ſervice. And 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.2. though they were Heathen, yet obey them.) So <hi>Paul</hi> ſends the ſervant againe to <hi>Philemon,</hi> to teach him with his knowledge, and to be willing to impart to him of his riches: ſo then is ſervice, <hi>eopacto,</hi> permitted by the Goſpell.</p>

                        <p>And fourthly, the applying of any of theſe to our ſelves; it is called <hi>well doing,</hi> or to bee a Benefactor: as we receive the gift of the mind from one that hath it; or a benefit from weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy men, or Rulers of experience, from the aged: or we beſtow a benefit.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. For the gifts of the mind: <hi>Juball, Gen.</hi> 4.20. and the reſt to whom God had given gifts of inventing crafts, were therefore cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Fathers.

And though that this be not the <hi>Feare of God;</hi> that is, <hi>(gratia gratum faciens)</hi> and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the more ſufficient man, though not ſo holy, nor the more religious; yet a company may uſe the benefit of it.</p>
                        <p>Theſe comming from God, muſt have honour; and the veſſell wherein he putteth them, for the gifts ſake, muſt have ſome honour.</p>
                        <p>Concerning the <hi>reverence</hi> we owe to him. The firſt part is, the acknowledgement of the excellencie that is in him, we freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe it to be in him, and in that degree and meaſure that it is in him. And we muſt commend ir, and praiſe God for beſtowing it on him, even as if he had beſtowed it on us: and deſire and pray that he would encreaſe it, and make it as fruitfull in him, as any gift in us, or that is be beſtowed on his Church. The Prophet, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.3. though <hi>Daniel</hi> lived at the ſame time with him, yet he giveth him an honourable title, ot teſtimonie; ſaying, <hi>Art thou wiſer then Daniel?</hi> If he had thought as others doe, that he that <hi>auget alienam famam, detrahit ſuae, he that adds to another mans fame, detracts from his owne:</hi> he would not ſo much have impaired his owne credit, by commending another, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. he confeſſeth there is a greater meaſure of wiſedome in <hi>Paul,</hi> and in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; and yet in thoſe Epiſtles <hi>Paul</hi> telleth them that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him to his face. And we ſee in <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 2.9. For there ſpeaking of <hi>James, John,</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> he calleth them Pillars of the Church, and of the Apoſtles. It is that that Saint <hi>John Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt</hi> ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. <hi>That he was not worthy, &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Hunc oportet creſcere, &amp;c.</hi> he muſt increaſe, &amp;c. The ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude is, as the light of the morning ſtarre, when the Sunne is up. This is not onely betweene our ſelves, but even to evill men: <hi>Judges</hi> 8.2. <hi>Gedeon</hi> plainely confeſſeth his inſufficiencie to the <hi>Ephraimites:</hi> that a Gleaning of <hi>Ephraim</hi> is better then a whole Vintage of <hi>Abiezer.</hi> And not onely in outward matters, but in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward alſo, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Davids</hi> teſtimony of <hi>Achitophels</hi> wiſdome,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:48000:218"/>
                           <hi>Davids</hi> enemy; that his counſell was as the Oracle of God. Then this is the firſt.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. And the contrary to this we doe commonly, being moved by <hi>Sauls</hi> evill ſpirit, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.8. we cannot abide that any mans thouſands ſhould be more then our owne. And becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> had but his thouſands, and <hi>David</hi> his ten thouſands; <hi>Saul</hi> had but a ſquint eye at <hi>David</hi> from that day forward. So we muſt not deny the gift of God that is in him, to be in him. And ſecondly, we muſt not extenuate, that which is in him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; as to ſay, but it is not ſo much as is thought, <hi>Job</hi> 1. the Devill ſaith of <hi>Job,</hi> he is righteous indeed, but not throughly, and as he ought. And when we cannot doe that, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not either deny it to be in him, nor to be in that meaſure that it is in him; then we wreake our ſelves upon the gifts; and we come to extenuate the gift it ſelfe. Tuſh it is a baſe gift, it is not ſo good a thing, there doth not ſo great good come of it: it is better to be well read, &amp;c. And then a fourth way; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the gift is ſuch, as all cannot but ſee, it is a rare gift, then we begin to ſhew a defect in another gift; in that part of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, wherein he is defective; he is no body, he can doe nothing in ſuch a thing: And then we goe to the uſe and uſage of it. But he abuſeth his gift; at the leaſt wiſe we will finde ſome fault with ſome imperfection in his life; one thing or other ever ſtandeth awry: So was Chriſt dealt with, <hi>Matthew</hi> 9.34. when the power of God was ſeene to be great in him, in caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Devills, &amp;c. they ſaid he did it by <hi>Beelzebub,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>Matthew</hi> 13.35. Why was it more in him then in another man; there can be no great matter in him; we know his bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, he is but the Carpenters Sonne, &amp;c. and then <hi>Matthew</hi> 9.11. they fly to ſift his converſation; he was an eater and drinker with Publicans, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>Now his part, that hath the gift correſpondent hereto, is, 1. <hi>Corinth.</hi> 15.10. to know who it is, that hath ſeparated him, and that there was nothing in him naturally, but it was given, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.17. there be many that will <hi>prodere ſapientiam indecore,</hi> with too well thinking of themſelves, they looſe all they haue: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is beſt to acknowledge the giver, and to be humble. And he may humble himſelfe thus; as the Apoſtle, though not with the defect of other gifts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. with the body of ſinne, that he carryeth about him: and ſo if he can bring himſelfe, 1. <hi>Coriath.</hi> 15.10. if the grace of God be in him, and not in vaine. for it may be in vaine, in reſpect of doing good in the Church. for it is commonly ſeene, that there be many great gifts with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fruit in many men. Secondly, it may be in vaine, in reſpect of himſelfe; that as the Preacher ſaith, he may be wiſe and never doe himſelfe good by it.</p>
                        <p>And laſt of all, not onely for this life, but for that to come, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. he may Preach to other, be a Miniſter, and at laſt be a caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>away himſelfe, if he be not humble. And as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 6.2, 3. mans
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48000:219"/>conceit will rend him like a Bull, like a wild Bull; ſo that neither he himſelfe, of himſelfe, nor any other ſhall receive any profit of him, or his gifts.</p>
                        <p>The duty is ſet downe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.10.16. that he goe before other in giving honour; that is, to make himſelfe equall to thoſe, that be his inferiours, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond of the Inferiour, ſeeing God (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6.) doth <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, ſeparate men by their gifts, not that they ſhould live alone; but he giveth them a degree of ſeparation from others, in beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them a more excellent gift, for the good of others; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cometh the ſecond: The duty is, <hi>praeferre,</hi> or <hi>praeeligere,</hi> to give it the place of preferment before another, which is not ſo great a gift as it is. For certainely where God hath placed his greateſt and beſt gifts, there he hath pointed the finger, that that man ſhould have the greateſt preheminence: The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle willeth them, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 12.31. ſtudy for the better gifts. Why ſo? Becauſe <hi>verſe</hi> 7. by them they ſhall doe the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit. And ſo conſequently, he is <hi>ſummo jure,</hi> and even by <hi>lex talio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis,</hi> to have the beſt place, to doe the moſt good in: So meane gifts God giveth for meanes places; great gifts, for great places. This is his order, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.15.</p>
                        <p n="4">4. If there ſhould be an election between gold, ſilver, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones, and learning; learning is to be choſen before the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.11. Therefore he would have the greateſt regard to be had of it. It is ſtrange that this being the ſecond point in all morall Phyloſophie, the firſt being <hi>Bonum eligendum, malum fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giendum,</hi> that which is good is to be choſen, and that which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill to be avoyded: this, the ſecond, <hi>Quod melius eſt eligendum,</hi> of two goods the beſt is to be choſen: and the third, <hi>ê malis minimum,</hi> of two evils the leaſt: that that being a principle of morall Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophie; yet now we muſt prove it, though it be a ground: and when we have proved it, men cannot obtaine it.</p>
                        <p>But the reaſons are, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. A fort of wicked men is met; and they cry, the counſell of <hi>Huſhai</hi> is better, &amp;c. therefore we will follow it. <hi>Eſay</hi> 40.20. The Idolater that is to make an image he will chooſe, <hi>lignum forte, &amp; lignum melius,</hi> the beſt timber he can get; It is a ſenſible thing by naturall reaſon, yet we cannot be brought to practiſe it.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. Now then there cometh another ſinne, by another reaſon: Thoſe that founded ſuch places as theſe are; had this reaſon ſaith the Lawyer, that they would give their goods to a Colledge, and not to their Kindred: becauſe if they made of their owne kindred heires, they ſhould have <hi>haeredes promiſcuos,</hi> they knew not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their poſterity ſhould be good or bad: but here they ſhould have <hi>haeredes ex optimis;</hi> the beſt ſhould be heires of the whole land. This was the inſtitution: but now it is otherwiſe.</p>
                        <p>Now beſides this, a third: For when as they gave their ſtatutes, many things run bare affirmative; but the Canon of the Law ſaith, <hi>Clariſsimè exponunt legiſlatores, ſe ſummevelle, quod maneant ſub vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:48000:219"/>ſacramenti.</hi> I charge thee to deale faithfully with me, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my will in the ſtatute. This is <hi>ſumme velle mandare ſub vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſacramenti:</hi> yet this is diſapointed. There is an evill opinion of ſome, which thinke that we are in ſuch caſes, like Potters; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe matters are <hi>res premii:</hi> And ſo whatſoever we doe, we may doe it <hi>ex mera gratia,</hi> as we will. But God was not of that minde: for if he were, to what end in making under officers, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derators, ſuch as Maſters of Colledges, ſhould he appoint them their qualities of knowledge, underſtanding, &amp;c? If theſe qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities be ſet downe, it is very certaine ſuch elections ſhould be, <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.2. We are to pick them as choſen ſhafts, and hide them in the Lords Quiver. It is thought to be ſpoken of Scholers: more plainely God himſelfe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.28. <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith, But now he hath taken thy Kingdome from thee, and given it to thy neighbour, that is thy Better. This is no injurie. It is the Devills election, to take from the better to give to the worſe.</p>
                        <p>1 <hi>Kings</hi> 2.32. <hi>David</hi> moveth <hi>Salomon</hi> of a ſcape in his time, touching <hi>Joab,</hi> that had killed <hi>Amaza,</hi> a man better then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: he commands he ſhould be killed, though he were allyed to <hi>David.</hi> Yet becauſe <hi>Amaza</hi> was his better, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.13. hee would have put out his Kinſman, and put <hi>Amaza</hi> in his roome, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>2 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.3. <hi>Jehu</hi> his meſſage to the Governours, &amp;c. <hi>Among all your Maſters children, chooſe out optimum &amp; aptiſsimum, &amp;c. the beſt and meeteſt of your Maſters Sonnes and ſet him on his Fathers throne:</hi> there is a plaine direction. So if there were a caſe of perill we ſhould doe. But the caſe of Juſtice over-ruleth; in that, we ſhould doe more then the Heathen: becauſe <hi>Heſter</hi> was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then <hi>Vaſthi, Heſter</hi> 2.9. thorefore the King depoſed <hi>Vaſthi,</hi> and ſet her up. <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.39. It is <hi>Pharoahs</hi> reaſon to <hi>Joſeph: Becauſe God hath endued thee with greateſt wiſedome, &amp;c.</hi> Though hee were a ſtranger borne, yet hee ſets him before all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                        <p>1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. The matter there paſſeth: For <hi>Samuel</hi> being to chooſe a King, at firſt began to be a little overſeene in chooſing <hi>Eliab:</hi> but after, when God bade him not regard the ſtature, but the gift; that is, Gods choice: then he comes in roundly, <hi>neque Dominus elegit hunc, neque hunc, &amp;c.</hi> the Lord hath not choſen this nor this: All denyed, till <hi>David</hi> came: and then he ſaith, <hi>hic eſt ipſe,</hi> this is he, <hi>Eſay</hi> 58.6. <hi>Becauſe yee keepe my Sabbaths, and chooſe thoſe things that pleaſe me, therefore I will bring you to my holy mountaine.</hi> So on the other ſide, <hi>Eſay</hi> 41.24. <hi>Behold theſe things are of no value, and yee have choſen them that be abomination, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 65. he ſheweth what puniſhment he would bring on them, <hi>verſe</hi> 12. <hi>Becauſe yee chooſe them, that I would not, therefore you ſhall leave your names as a curſe, &amp;c.</hi> Sowe ſee what God deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in this caſe.</p>
                        <pb n="424" facs="tcp:48000:220"/>
                        <p>Now to give the reaſons ſet downe by the Counſels, in their Canons in the Primitive Church; this is one reaſon: He whom God calleth not, ought not to be choſen; and he calleth not, but when he calleth to a better: otherwiſe he will not bleſſe them in their calling; and therefore when he bleſſeth them not, they are <hi>ventres,</hi> meer Bellies; and that is their care, and they ſtudy for nothing elſe, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 13.3. they are there called light perſons; the bleſſing of God not being with them: becauſe they were not called of him. Note moreover that it is worſe to make an <hi>Hophni,</hi> then not to correct an <hi>Hophni. Ely</hi> was blamed for not correcting, in that place: therefore much greivouſer had his ſinne been, if he had put in an <hi>Hophni,</hi> whoſe minde is all on the <hi>Pot.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Thirdly, this is one of their <hi>Maxims</hi> in Divinity: <hi>Indignum promovere eſt decipere,</hi> to promote an unworthy man is to deceive. They deceive the party, that gave his goods to be beſtowed on them that were worthy: and they make a lye to the World, and they beare an evident falſe witneſſe: For they doe as much as ſay, <hi>This man is meeteſt.</hi> And if any ſhould come to a temporall Lord, and ſet him an unprofitable ſervant, promiſing one that ſhould ſerve his turne; this were plaine deceit: and there might an Action in Law be had againſt him. And ſo, more treacherous is their dealing, that in GODS ſervice, place unprofitable Servants.</p>
                        <p>Fourthly, by theſe meanes they doe <hi>ponere ſub periculo,</hi> they bring into danger the ſoules committed to them. Set an <hi>unmeete</hi> Workman to any thing, and the work will be in danger of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. The danger is foure fold.</p>

                        <p>The duty of the Superiour in this regard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.21. to think of himſelfe as it becommeth him. <hi>Our Tribe is the leaſt of all the Tribes, &amp;c.

                        <p>The third point of the Inferiour is, to make uſe of the gifts of one that is better then he: or <hi>ſe conferre, ubi Deus eſt,</hi> to come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.15. the people come to aske of God, when they asked of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.9. when they came to aske of God, they came to the Prophet; becauſe he was brought up <hi>in rebus Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovae,</hi> in the things concerning God: to make uſe of the Prophets.

                              <hi>Senes.</hi> The duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards old men.</note>The duty of the body, that is between the Old and the Young; the Apoſtle willeth the younger to be dutifull to the Elder, as to Fathers, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                        <p>The firſt duty is, <hi>Job</hi> 32.6, 7. The young muſt have their mouthes locked, and muſt hold their tongue, ſo long as their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were in preſence. <hi>Elihu,</hi> though he were an excellent young man, yet he held his peace, becauſe his elders were in place: the reaſon, <hi>Job</hi> 12.12. becauſe <hi>among the ancient there is wiſedome; and in the multitude of yeares there is underſtanding:</hi> they have gone through more. The Philoſophers counſell is, that when we have gotten our owne demonſtrations, we ſhould give eare to the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrable poſitions of old men, that they have had by experience. And it was the confuſion of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 12.6. When he ſhould have dealt with the Ancients, he did the contrary, and took counſell of the young men.</p>
                        <p>And the duty that they are to returne back againe; that they be not, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.20. <hi>pueri centum an norum,</hi> children an hundred yeares old. <hi>Jerome</hi> tranſlates it <hi>Elementarios ſenes,</hi> old men which have not as yet learned their <hi>A. B. C.</hi> but it is required that they have <hi>canum intellectum,</hi> as they have <hi>canum caput,</hi> that their intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect be as grave as their haire. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, there is <hi>aetas temporis,</hi> and <hi>aetas meriti,</hi> an age of time, and an age of merit. <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>arbores autumnales,</hi> trees that begin to bloſſome in the end of harveſt, when their fruit ſhould be gathered. This is the ſhadow of an old man without underſtanding. But though they be ſuch, yet <hi>(ut ante)</hi> we muſt honour them: though they be not worthy <hi>hoc pati,</hi> to receive this honour, yet it is meet for us, <hi>hoc agere,</hi> we muſt give it.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond duty to old men, <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.32. <hi>aſſurgere,</hi> to riſe up in ſigne of reverence: becauſe they have (as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.9.) the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God: that is called <hi>antiquus dierum,</hi> the ancient of dayes: and <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.29. they have the crowne, whereby they reſemble eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: So they have a double reſemblance of eternity, <hi>ſenectus eſt veſtigium aeternitatis,</hi> old age is the print of eternity, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.31. it is a crowning of a man, if he have lived righteouſly, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.2.

                        <p>The third duty of the Younger: We muſt <hi>conſurgere,</hi> that is, <hi>provide for their eaſe,</hi> for they are weake: young boyes are not to ſit, when ancient men ſtand. <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.20. When a man is paſt the age of fifty, he muſt not travell in the Tabernacle; yet he muſt have his allowance, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 3.5. his prophecie, that children ſhould preſume againſt the ancient; and old men to ſtand, and they to ſit, a thing againſt ſenſe: ſurely, <hi>ſic nobis fiet,</hi> ſo ſhall it be done to us, when we come to yeares: <hi>&amp; ſic fiet noſtris,</hi> ſo ſhall others of our humours doe to our Fathers, as we doe to others: And we ſhall not make their age (which is a burthen unto them) to be light; as we ſhould, by a reverence in young men.

                        <p>Come to the three degrees in the Common-wealth, as Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Gentry, &amp;c. they are by the Holy Ghoſt ſtiled Fathers, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently is there a correſpondent due to them, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.8. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> calleth a wealthy man Father: <hi>I pray thee give unto thy ſervants and to thy ſonne David, whatſoever commeth to thy hand.</hi> The reaſon of the duty they have, is, becauſe there may proceed a common benefit by them, to the Common-wealth; as for Warre, the <hi>ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vus reipublicae,</hi> is <hi>argentum,</hi> round pay for Souldiers is the nerves and ſinewes of a Common-wealth; and it is eſpecially in their hands: Therefore it is, that becauſe God hath bleſſed them more in their <hi>oeconomicks,</hi> the Common-wealth doth account of them more; and giveth them a degree above other.</p>
                        <p>In the 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.19. is their duty: To be willing to impart their goods, for a common profit; as <hi>Nehem.</hi> 5.17. he had beſide his owne Family, a hundred and fifty of the Rulers which he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at his owne table.</p>
                        <p>It is better exemplified, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19.32. <hi>Barzillai</hi> a very rich man; and <hi>David</hi> all the time he was at <hi>Mahanami,</hi> lay at his charge: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he rewarded him for it. And 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 15.20. the King of <hi>Aſſur</hi> would overcome Juda, if he had not money preſently: but that <hi>Menahen</hi> being then King, tooke of every man of wealth, a <hi>great benevolence, &amp;c.</hi> So for proviſion of Armies and things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and then their duty in the Common-wealth in regard of this, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31.23. is to preferre them, and to ſet them in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to place them among the Elders in the gate, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, (and it is a good reaſon) if they have beene carefull in their owne houſe; they will be much more in the Common-wealth.</p>
                        <p>The ſecond duty is; that when a man hath wealth, there be ſome vertues that he may exerciſe excellently, that others cannot, <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence, liberality, almes, &amp;c.</hi> and if he be allyed to a Noble man, to helpe forward good cauſes. So becauſe they are to be helpers in good cauſes, they muſt <hi>venire in partem honoris,</hi> they muſt have their honour, <hi>verſ.</hi> 18. We have an example of this duty, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 31.6. voluntary oblations for the Temple; ſo as there were great heapes left: great proviſion for the maintenance of the <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites.</hi> And 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 4.10. the wealthy woman ſaith to her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>I pray, lets furniſh a Chamber, &amp;c.</hi> There was a care of helping the Church, of helping Prophets, Schooles and Colledges, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.41. Some caſt in a great deale into the Treaſurie. This is the ſecond duty. And then conſequently, the Common-weale <hi>contra,</hi> back againe, is to deale, that theſe men may be eſpecially good; and ſo doe good, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.8. There was a great care leſt <hi>Elimas</hi> ſhould have corrupted <hi>Sergius Paulus,</hi> the cheife man in that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey: therefore <hi>Paul</hi> dealeth roundly with him, <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. when he had made an end of all, he would have him take or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that rich men may be good, and doe good to many. The
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48000:222"/>Heathen man ſaith, If I were to make <hi>Amphions harpe,</hi> I would beſtow greater paines in making that, then if I were to make a common Harpers harpe.</p>
                        <p>The third duty of Rich men <hi>downward,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. not to be high minded, nor to truſt in their riches, <hi>Pro.</hi> 18.11. they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly count their riches their ſtrong City or Towre; that is, when they have any cauſe, though there be no right in it, yet they will doe it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 31. they will undertake evill matters, truſting in their wealth: and ſo likewiſe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.17. <hi>Naball</hi> was ſuch a ſurly fellow, that no body could ſpeake to him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 16.2. <hi>The rich and the poore meet, and the Lord hath made them both.</hi> The rich muſt not deſpiſe the poore: And then the duty, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18. of them that be under, is to account themſelves their Sonnes, and them their Fathers.</p>

Whatſoever is <hi>ſub ratione beneficii,</hi> may be conſidered as a benefit or good turne, of any thing done to any man, it cometh under here.

                        <list>
                           <item>Firſt, Rich men muſt doe it: They are not bound to any one in particular; <hi>in officib</hi> they are, but not <hi>in beneficio:</hi> They may make their choice, but to ſome they muſt doe it; they muſt give whereſoever they are; they muſt not marke mens ingratitude. And the Heathen man giveth a reaſon, why they ſhould not give nothing: <hi>melius eſt ut pereat beneficium apud illum, quam apud te,</hi> it is better that he ſhould abuſe thy benefit that receives it, then thee in not giving it: that is, they muſt doe it freely. And theſe men that ſay our preferments are benefits, yet they doe not give them freely: They looke not, as the Phyloſopher ſaith, <hi>ubi optime,</hi> but <hi>ubi quaeſtuoſi ſsime,</hi> where they may doe it for the greater good, but where they may beſtow it for the greater gaine: ſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon men, as a man alloweth his Horſe, when he is to ride forth; he alloweth him ſo much bread, becauſe he ſhould ride on him, &amp;c. So they beſtow on ſuch a one, becauſe they be to uſe him. So the Phyſitian looſeth his honour, now a dayes, <hi>perdit honorem gratiae propter praemium;</hi> for ſure it is, he cannot ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be recompenced, that ſaveth a mans life: but now becauſe he proſtituteth his Art for gaine; becauſe he doth now as it were buy and ſell, he looſeth his great honour. <hi>Dignus eſt decipi, qui de recipiendo cogitavit, cum dedit.</hi> He is well worthy to be cheated that when he giveth, thinketh of receiving; and feareth leaſt the party ſhould not fulfill his expectation. I thinke the World will ſhortly make Indentures, when they give Benefits, to bind men to be <hi>thankfull.</hi>
                           </item>
                           <item>Secondly, another property, it is the rule: it is not now as it was. <hi>Apage homines, quorum lenta ſunt beneficia, praecipites injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> away with thoſe men that are quick enough to doe one an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, but will conſider on't before they will doe you any good: but
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48000:222"/>now, <hi>proſande odium ſimul, &amp; infunde beneficium.</hi> They will not let him have all the benefit at once; bu firſt weary out his pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then a little pleaſure or benefit. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſheweth it very well: They will have <hi>longum ſpectaculum potentiae ſuae,</hi> it muſt be, Your worſhips, your honours pleaſure, and many ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: and be forſooth muſt be prayed; and they looke for an <gap reason="foreign">

                           <item>Thirdly, that when you have done the benefit to any, you muſt forget it: If a man beſtowed a benefit on me, and I know that he ſhould beſtow it <hi>ut ducat me in triumphum,</hi> to make me the object of his <hi>Vaine-glory,</hi> I would never thanke him for his benefit: nay, I would thanke him more, if he had never beſtowed it: ſo he had not done this. Therefore it muſt be done, and they not know of it.</item>
                        </list>
                        <p>Now the <hi>Receiver</hi> oweth a Recogniſance.</p>
                        <p>Firſt, that ſuch a man was Gods Inſtrument, or <hi>principium,</hi> by whom ſuch a bleſſing of God came to him; and ſo to acknowledge. There is nothing that the Fathers have concerning this, but they take it out of <hi>Seneca.</hi> And ſurely but for ſome points that the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks hold, his ſeven Books, <hi>De beneficiis,</hi> are very excellent Books, and worthy the reading. <hi>Seneca</hi> would have <hi>eandem hilaritatem ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepti beneficii, quae fuit petiti,</hi> the ſame cheerfulneſſe after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, as there was in asking a benefit. Becauſe <hi>gratia</hi> doth ſo ſoone <hi>ſeneſcere,</hi> becauſe a good turne doth ſo ſoon wax old: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that a mans value or eſtimation ſhould be all one, that he made before that, or when he received the benefit.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, not onely this is required, but alſo <hi>effuſio affectus,</hi> the effuſion of this affection; and this is <hi>teſtimonium excellentiae exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> a teſtimonie of his externall excellency, that God hath exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch a one, to be a Benefactor. If he remember it, I need not: as <hi>exprobatio</hi> is <hi>ſatisfactio pro beneficio;</hi> ſo, if he forget it, I muſt not, but muſt tell it; and not extenuate it: but be <hi>benignus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pres,</hi> interpret it well; as that it was a great benefit; or if it were not, that it was a great one to me: if it were not neither, yet I know he did it, with ſo good an affection, that I cannot but think of it highly.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if happely ever he ſhall need (but we muſt not deſire, or wiſh it) that we be ready to doe the like for him: and <hi>interim</hi> to acknowledge that we cannot recompence it. Though now they call <hi>finem injuriae beneficium,</hi> they thinke they doe a benefit by making an end of their injury; and it is a pollicy now a dayes, they will <hi>mergere eos, ut extrahentur,</hi> throw them into the water that they may pull them out, and when they have pulled them out, they thinke that they are beholden to them; ſuch benefits muſt not be. I am not to wiſh that he were in need; but if ever he ſtand in need, my aſſiduity, and diligence about him, and the beſt counſell I can give him, he ſhall be ſure off. I will alwayes wiſh him well, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48000:223"/>that I ſhall never be able to recompence him. And this is <hi>recompence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>Now <hi>Unthankfulneſſe</hi> is a great vice.<note place="margin">Unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</note> But there is one kind that is now thought unthankfulneſſe, and yet it is not. Every one that receiveth a benefit, he muſt not onely requite it with the like, <hi>par pari referre,</hi> but he muſt <hi>trudere in manus,</hi> requite that, and doe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: or elſe it is not <hi>beneficium.</hi> And when he faileth himſelfe, <hi>tranfferre in Deum,</hi> he muſt deſire God to recompence him.</p>
                        <p>But when as a man beſtoweth a benefit upon his Inferiour, and afterward doth looke, that he ſhould like what he liketh, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like what he miſliketh, and to be at command; and if he will not follow, then to be accounted <hi>unthankfull:</hi> this is not <hi>unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi> For firſt, unthankfulneſſe is <hi>res gratiae,</hi> not <hi>res officii,</hi> is in matters of favour and not of duty: therefore it is unthankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the other.</p>
                        <p>And ſecondly, it is <hi>injuſtice:</hi> For that is a benefit, <hi>quod licet non dare,</hi> or <hi>dare,</hi> which I may give or not give; but in a matter of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice I cannot requite him; becauſe there is not <hi>non facere,</hi> or <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere,</hi> l liberty of doing or not doing: therefore I will ſay, That that I may doe, or not doe, if he require it, I will doe it. But now he cometh to me in a matter of Juſtice: let him come to me, <hi>in re gratiae,</hi> in a matter of curteſie or favour, and I will be thankfull: let him not come to me <hi>in re officii,</hi> in a matter of duty.</p>
                        <p>Another (and that is better then this) is this: He would havo me follow his appetite, to doe an injuſt thing; I will not conſent to him: Is this <hi>unthankfulneſſe?</hi> The rule is, <hi>quod tibi fieri non vis, alteri ne fcceris,</hi> thou mayſt not doe that to another, which thou wouldeſt not have done to thy ſelfe; a man is made the rule of duty to his neighbour. If my appetite would lead me wrong, or to any injuſt thing, ſhould I follow it? No, for I ſhould wrong my ſelfe; becauſe thus doing, I doe <hi>conſentire peccato in me,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the motions of ſinne within me. And ſo in like manner, if I conſent to him; he would have me to doe him a diſpleaſure, for my pleaſure: he would have me doe evill for good; he would have me to doe his ſoule hurt, to conſent to ſinne. The heathen man calleth it, <hi>occidere amando,</hi> a killing love; and ſo not to doe this, is <hi>ſpecies injuriae, &amp; ſpecies ingratitudinis, quae ſaepe incidit in virum bonum,</hi> it hath a ſhew of injurie and ingratitude, which is often many a good mans caſe: But a good man, <hi>per mediam infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miam hujus ingratitudinis,</hi> will <hi>tendere ad officium,</hi> this reproach of Unthankefulneſſe, maketh him looke the narrower to his duty.</p>

                        <p>And for deeds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. Our outward deeds ought to be ſuch, to our Superiours, as they may take pleaſure, and rejoyce in them: and they that may not governe us with ſorrow. <hi>Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plum,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.6. <hi>David</hi> did not hurt <hi>Saul</hi> in the Cave; but onely cut the lappe of his coate: yet his heart touched him; it being a diſgrace to the garment of <hi>Saul.</hi> The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. exhorteth Chriſtians to abound in every good worke; they muſt ſhew forth a fruit of righteouſneſſe: and he ſaith there, it muſt be <hi>abundans fructus,</hi> a fruit that aboundeth.

Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 18.22. ſtanding before <hi>Annas;</hi> for ſaying, <hi>I am not bound to accuſe my ſelfe;</hi> preſently for ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo, a Catchpoll layeth him on the face.

                        <p>The ſame was the caſe of <hi>David,</hi> why he might not goe and fight, 1 <hi>Samuel</hi> 29.9.

                           </gap>, <hi>Wee will conſider of it.</hi> And it ſhall be as much amended, as if you had not told them. This maketh a fourth ſigne. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.13. one telleth <hi>Joab</hi> of <hi>Abſaloms</hi> hanging; and <hi>Joab</hi> ſaid, Diddeſt thou ſee him, and not kill him? Thou ſhouldeſt have killed him, and I would have given thee a reward: The other ſaid, You ſee what ſtrict charge the King gave you and <hi>Abiſhai,</hi> and <hi>It<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat,</hi> not to lay hands upon him: But you would have happely ſaid to the King, He is worthy to dye: if I ſhould have done it, you would have beene againſt mee your ſelfe. Hee coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelleth him to have done that, which he himſelfe would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in him.</p>
                        <p>Fifthly, another (and it is greatly complained of by the Fathers, and was wont to be in the Primitive Church:) It is not Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity that abrogateth Juſtice. They would have their Rulers doe wrong to a Chriſtian Biſhop: then hee muſt have Juſtice: and when it commeth to the Emperour, Why, ſaith he, you ſhall have Juſtice. A day of hearing is appointed, if it be plaine, and when it commeth to the point; then the Deputy commeth to him, and ſaith, You are a Chriſtian, you ought to be patient; you need not follow your ſuit; you ſhould rather forgive it, &amp;c. So they, rather then to ſhew their folly, would give over. So the Chriſtians were dealt withall, and loaden thus, till their backes were broken. Such is that; <hi>Acts</hi> 16.39. They goe roundly to worke with <hi>Paul,</hi> they whip him, and his fellowes; and the next day would have let them goe privily. <hi>Paul</hi> among the reſt, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this courage to him and ſaith, <hi>They would not;</hi> becauſe they had corrected them openly without a cauſe, he would have them come themſelves and fetch them out; ſo that they were faine to fetch them out themſelves. So when men deſire not that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity ſhould drowne Juſtice, it is a ſigne of a good government.</p>
                        <p>Sixthly, the <hi>thriving of the righteous:</hi> a good ſigne, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.7. <hi>In a good mans time the righteous ſhould flouriſh. Contra,</hi> as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man ſaith, where it is not <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, then the Sycophant: <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>, and then he that is naughty and lewd: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26.16. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, <hi>If God have done it, let him ſmell the ſavour of a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: if men, curſed bee they before the Lord.</hi> So hee knew there were Sycophant talebearers, as <hi>Doeg:</hi> that tolde <hi>Saul</hi> of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> being at <hi>Nob,</hi> and in the Cave: He was the cheife of all his ſervants, over all his flockes: a great office in thoſe dayes.
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48000:226"/>My meaning is this, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 29.9. that theſe putrid members be cut off, and the righteous be releeved for the Commandement ſake. <hi>Beatus qui non ſuit ſubjectus indigno,</hi> as the Heathen man ſaith: When <hi>Caeſar</hi> firſt entred into his tyranny; he gave pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, <hi>ſic ut boneſtaret hornines, &amp; tamen inquinaret ornamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> So places of good credit are diſcredited by placing ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers as diſcredit the places.

                        <p>The ſixt Rule: The procuring of it to others. A precent, <hi>Pro.</hi> 24.21. an example, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.10. and 26.9. That for dehor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Now for exhortation, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 25.24. <hi>Feare not to ſerve the Caldeans, let us ſerve the King of Babel, and wee ſhall be well.</hi> This is to be underſtood out of <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.3. when the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is meeke, and commands that which is right in the Lords eyes: not ſuch as the gainſaying of <hi>Corah</hi> was. But <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 44.16. if the Chaire of Juſtice doe <hi>ſingere moleſtiam,</hi> doe cauſe heavie commandements, <hi>praeſter ſtatutum;</hi> then, <hi>quis conſurget mecum.</hi> In unjuſt commands, I will not doe: then are we both to harden our ſelves and others: and wiſh them not to doe it.</p>

                           <note place="margin">The reaſon.</note> 
                           <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] In generall it was ſaid, that it was to all a generall promiſe; as in the ſecond Commandement, <hi>To them that love me, &amp;c.</hi> But this is particulerly to one, and hath a particuler promiſe, <hi>Long life.</hi> So that is true, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.2. it is the firſt Commandement with particuler promiſe.</p>
                        <p>Now the reaſon to this Commandement. It is a common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbe: <hi>Adorant plures ſolem orientem, quam occidentem,</hi> more wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Sun riſing then ſetting: our parents be compared to the Sunne going downe, <hi>Job</hi> 12.5. When a man is toward his end, he is like a candle that burneth within the ſocket. Therefore we neglect them; but hope for ſomewhat to come by them to us; if they grow up with us, and ſo may profit us hereafter; but when they are one foot in the grave, we have there done with them, we eſteeme them no longer: therefore here is a reaſon or motive from God that if we give due honour unto them, we ſhall be rewarded our ſelves with honour and long life.</p>
                        <p>Secondly, the convenient proportion of the promiſes; and that it is moſt juſt; for that it is ſaid of the Heathen, <hi>Si reddide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris beneſicium gratis, tuere tu beneficium:</hi> if he become thankfull, <hi>orna quantum potes.</hi> In our birth we received a benefit from our Parents: that is, <hi>life:</hi> being thankfull to them, this benefit ſhall be preſerved. Therefore God will have life to be preſerved of them, of whom we had it. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. Piety (one of the ſpeciall parts wherof this is) hath promiſes of this life, and of that to come. The Heathen man ſaith, if all the Adverbs were linked together, and <hi>bene &amp; male,</hi> well and ill, were out, it were to no purpoſe. Therefore God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.16. addeth an explication of this: <hi>That thy dayes may be long: And that it may goe well with thee: Auguſtine, ut non ſolum vita longa, ſed laeta,</hi> that thy life may be not onely long
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:48000:226"/>but chearefull. Now the means he ſaith, ſhall be our Parents; that by their bleſſing they may prolong our dayes: he hath annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his bleſſing to the bleſſing of the Parent. For this bleſſing of life in the Scripture, came from <hi>Noah;</hi> the bleſſing firſt was to <hi>Sem,</hi> of the life to come; and to <hi>Japheth,</hi> of this life: <hi>God ſhall perſwade Japheth, &amp;c.</hi> ſhewing that the Parents giving it from the ſoule, and Faith (<hi>Heb.</hi> 11.20, 21. making it a fruit of faith: <hi>By faith Iſaac bleſſed Jacob concerning things to come, &amp;c.</hi>) It will worke miracles; <hi>Sem</hi> and his ſeed had a great priviledge, for the World to come: <hi>Japheth,</hi> for this life: and a curſe to <hi>Cham,</hi> both for this life, and the life to come: his ſeed hath alwayes beene in ſubjection, and they have had ſmall light of Religion, and ſmall ſparkes of the Goſpell: Againe, in the bleſſing from <hi>Iſaac</hi> on <hi>Jacob; legatur lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus perpendantur circumſtantiae, Gen.</hi> 27.7. <hi>&amp;c. He bleſſed him with &amp;c. and he was bleſſed.</hi> He loved <hi>Eſau</hi> more; and ſo no doubt the bleſſing had been his; but that by Gods providence, it was carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Jacob: Gen.</hi> 48.20. A ſtrange bleſſing (for the manner) and mighty (for effect) was that of <hi>Jacob</hi> on <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſonnes: and <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. He to <hi>Joſeph;</hi> becauſe he had fed his Father, bleſſeth him with the bleſſing of the Heaven, the Ayre, the Deepe; and that Tribe continued longeſt in proſperity. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.15. <hi>Vos eſtis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedicti Domini,</hi> ye are the bleſſed of the Lord: and ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the bleſſing being of the Lord, of which Parents be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; it is inſtrumentally to be aſcribed to the bleſſing of the Parents; becauſe it is they that have made it, by their bleſſing. All this is to provoke the prayer of the Superiours.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Whether is this promiſe fulfilled?</hi>

More reaſons. There is common adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: Why? God giveth to ſome of his, adverſitie; and not to ſome of the wicked; becauſe, if he ſhould give to all the wicked, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. there would be no judgement: <hi>contra,</hi> if he ſhould give all adverſitie to his children, then <hi>Pſal</hi> 11.12. <hi>certe Deus non reſpicit nos,</hi> Gods providence ſhould not be in this World: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that he may ſhew that he hath a providence; he will give to
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:48000:227"/>ſome of his, theſe good things: And that he may ſhew that he hath a Judgement, he will give them to ſome of the wicked. He would not have theſe good things to be altogether in the wicked; becauſe then they would thinke, that God had not the diſpoſition of them. And as <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.16. they would ſacrifice to their Not, and to their Yarne: and <hi>contra,</hi> if good men ſhould have all, and the Devill none, then the Devill would ſay, as he did, <hi>Job</hi> 1.19. <hi>Nunquid ſervit Deo gratis? Doth Job ſerve God for nought?</hi> How then? Firſt, <hi>bene &amp; male</hi> muſt come in; it is not ſo much long life, as the comfort and delight which we enjoy in our life, which is here promiſed as a bleſſing. Wherefore 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.4. <hi>Elias</hi> he quits God with his promiſe, <hi>I pray thee take away my life, for I am not better then my Fathers:</hi> and <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.16. it is expounded: They ſhall prolong your dayes, ſo long as you can live proſperouſly and well. It muſt be a benefit, if a man have a promiſe of a long life; if it come to be a diſpleaſure, it were better not to have it.</p>

The ſixth concerning the life of man, the preſervation of it: the ſeventh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning chaſtity, or the preſervation of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock: the eighth concerning his goods: the ninth concerning his good name.</p>
                        <p>The Commandement is exceeding ſhort, God providing for the memory of man; therefore, he hath made choyce in one word,<note place="margin">The commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie a great catalogue of ſinnes; making choyce of murther, which is almoſt the higheſt: that hee might ſhew the under affections are to him no leſſe odious then murther it ſelfe: which if they had not beene expreſſed in this word, would have ſeemed light.</p>
                        <p>The Commandement then is expounded in the Law it ſelfe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17.18. By murther he meaneth tale-carrying, that may redound to mans bloud: ſtanding againſt the bloud of his neighbour, hating his brother, not rebuking, ſuffering him to ſinne; revengement, or mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe of wrongs: Our Saviour Chriſt alſo, <hi>Matthew</hi> 5.22. and ſo from thence to <hi>verſ.</hi> 27. at the 38. <hi>verſ.</hi> and ſo by the end, giveth a large ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or commentary on this Commandement.</p>
                        <p>The like hath Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> almoſt through his firſt Epiſtle, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, <hi>cap.</hi> 3.14.15. where he ſaith plainely, that whoſoever hateth, is a murtherer: and ſo conſequently doth ſhew plainely, that God rather giveth his Law to the heart, the fountaine of the affections, then to the actions, that man doth take order for.</p>
                        <p>Thoſe places we muſt weigh and conſider: when we have weighed them, we ſhall finde it true that the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.27. that this affection of anger and hatred, is the gate of the Devill, whereby,<note place="margin">Anger, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils gate.</note> as <hi>Iames</hi> 3.16. there is way made for ſtrifes and debates, and to a great many of evill workes.</p>

There is the wiſe Kings ſtudy: or this ſhall bee his ſtudy, how to ſcatter the wicked, or to make the wheele goe over them: For as it was found in the eſtabliſhing of the Magiſtrate, that it was <hi>Caines</hi> City that made <hi>Seth</hi> to make himſelfe a City; and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that, but there were alſo ſundry of <hi>Caines</hi> ſpirit, that came in among the ſeed of <hi>Seth:</hi> therefore heed was to be had to them, as <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.18.21. to the Hee Goates, to the Rammes, and to the fat ſheepe; for they would puſh at the leane ſheepe with their hornes: and as the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man ſaith, <hi>Tam neceſſe eſt,</hi> it is as needfull, that there ſhould be, <hi>qui arceant homines,</hi> ſuch as may reſtraine men from outward invaſion, <hi>qua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neceſſariae ſunt palpebrae oculis,</hi> as the eye-lids are needfull for the eyes: for they keepe out outward injuries, and that that would hurt the eyes, and the ſight from hurting it ſelf: for elſe it would diſperſe it ſelf too much: therefore, expedient it is, that <hi>prius ſanguis funderetur, ne plus ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis funderetur,</hi> that bloud be firſt ſhed, leſt more bloud afterwards ſhould be ſhed.

For (as we ſay) it is not the ſword that killeth and ſheddeth mans bloud; ſo neither doth the Magiſtrate, the Miniſter of it, nor the Judge: but the chiefe cauſe doth it: for <hi>quod eſt organum utenti, id eſt miniſter jubenti,</hi> what the toole is to him that uſeth it, ſuch is the Officer to him that commandeth him.

So we muſt not provoke him by any manner of theſe meanes. Thus much of the ſecond point.</p>
                        <p>The third rule, concerning the ſpirituall law. Our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.22. <hi>niſi ſanguis ſequeretur,</hi> unleſſe bloud were ſhed, they counted it no murther, nor way to murther: as Chriſt there teacheth them to goe further then the arme or blow that is given: that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are outwardly committed, and accompany murther, are nothing elſe, and are but <hi>fructus irae,</hi> the fruits of anger: and that is the roote of Wormwood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.15. and that muſt be pluckt up. For when theſe bitter fruits come, by vertue of that which is in the heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. he boldly pronounceth, that out of the heart proceed murthers: and ſo thoſe that lay plaiſters onely to the armour and weapon, ſhall never helpe the diſeaſe. For it is noted further, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.16. this is Gods reaſon, that murther is not capitall of it ſelfe, if it be not that he hated his brother before: therefore, this is to be puniſhed.</p>
                        <p>As in the begining it was ſaid, ſo now, that as the beginning of pride was the fountaine of the breaches of this Commandement: ſo is it that likewiſe, from which this anger commeth. The wiſe man, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13.10. he ſaith thas; Onely by pride, contention and anger commeth; and therefore, the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.26. ſaith: Bee not deſirous of vaine glory this is the roote that maketh one envious, and provoketh one againſt another: ſo that envies &amp; murthers came here: for, as it was ſaid in the beginning, every one ſetteth this downe with himſelfe, <hi>That he is good,</hi> and whoſoever loveth him, doth his duty; and ſo conſequently, he muſt be good: as on the other ſide, hurting him, and envying him, that man muſt neceſſarily be evill, ſo hee muſt conceive an anger againſt him: <hi>omnis ira ſibi videTur juſta,</hi> each froward man accounts his anger juſt: as before, <hi>omnis iniquitas mentitur ſibi:</hi> therefore it is that it commeth to the ſecond, for anger is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of two things, 1. The griefe, for whatſoever in dignity is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us. The 2. a deſire to require it.

                        <p>That that remaineth, is this: The avoiding of the roote of this affection: we may referre it to the meanes.</p>
                        <p>The firſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. It is expedient to have <hi>anticipatum animum,</hi> a minde voide of prejudice: becauſe that men oft in wrath, are corrupt in judgement; whether it be by want of skill, or by an evill deſire. For holding this principle, that evill things are to be eſteemed: and ſo conſequently every man is perſwaded, that there is ſome good thing in himſelfe, and therefore will make men ſee his power: therefore let a man know, that he hath to deale with men of like infirmities to himſelfe. And as this is good, ſo it is expedient, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.24. not to joyne neare friendſhip with any angry man: 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.17. ſuch as <hi>Nabal</hi> was: if he have (as the Heathen man ſaid) <hi>veſparum examen,</hi> a ſhrewd memory for all turnes, he is to be avoided: ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.10. his adviſe there, that the ſcornefull man that maketh more accompt of his jeſt, then his friend, and doth not rather love <hi>dictum quam a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micum perdere,</hi> to loſe his jeſt, then his friend; caſt him out, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention ſhall ceaſe and goe.</p>
                        <p>And thirdly, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.20. when he would have all heart-burnings and griefes betweene friends to ceaſe; as if ye lay to no wood, the fire will ceaſe: ſo without a tale-bearer breaches will ceaſe: and as he ſaith, <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. hee will outwardly in his countenance, ſhew himſelfe dutifull; but where he may be beleeved, he will utter the gall of Aſpes. Now then, beyond this, as we have here to be avoided three perſons, as <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.30. not to joyne with them, not to ſtrive without a cauſe: ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.17. not to meddle with contentions that belong not to us: unleſſe it be, <hi>Exod.</hi> 2.13. with the contentions of our brethren,
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:48000:241"/>to ſet them together againe; elſe it is the next way to bring on us an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and the fruits of anger. This is it that the Apoſtles, Prophets and holy men of God have alwayes exhorted to, before the affection beriſen. Now when this affection is preſt upon us, and beginneth to riſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.14. that the ſpirit of man is able to ſuſtaine his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or plainely, <hi>Prov.</hi> 19.11. that he is able to deferre his anger, and not to let it preſently guſh out; as he ſaid to the Athenians, If <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> be dead to day, he will be dead to morrow, and the next day: therefore make no bonefires too ſoone: ſo to ſuſpend our affections.</p>
                        <p>It is <hi>affectio ameambulo,</hi> and not <hi>affectio pediſſequa,</hi> an affection which muſt uſher us: <hi>Iames</hi> 1.16. calleth it to be <hi>tardus adiram,</hi> ſlow to wrath: and <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. he giveth a very good reaſon of it, becauſe the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluity of the wrath of man doth never <hi>operari juſtitiam dei,</hi> worke the righteouſneſſe of God: therefore, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. there is good counſell: for he ſaith, that the beginning of a mans anger is, as if a man ſhould make an hole in a banke, for water to goe through: at the firſt it is eaſie to ſtop it, but after the water getteth in more and more, and caſteth downe more earth, then it is impoſſible. Now when wee ſpeake thus of anger, we ſpeake of it, either as we are angry with other men; or as it is in other men concerning us: In the one (<hi>i.</hi> if it be ours) then reſiſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.27. and in the other, then <hi>cede,</hi> yeeld, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So falleth in corrupt cuſtome, for the courſe of our nature is, when it avoideth any evil, it avoideth it ſo vehemently, that ſomtime, if there be any good with it, it putteth out the good too.

                           </note> a property of goods appertaining to me, and to another: this muſt firſt be knowne.</p>
                        <p>It is therefore plaine by <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.1. he ſaith, <hi>The earth is the Lords, &amp;c. i.</hi> it is his, he made it: and ſo conſequently, he hath right to it alone. After that he made it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115.16. <hi>Coelum coeli Domino, &amp; terram dedit filtis hominum,</hi> the Heaven, yea even the Heavens are the Lords, but the Earth hath he given to the children of men. And ſo there is a giving over of Gods right unto men: And the warrant hereof we have, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. Fill the earth, and <hi>dominamini,</hi> have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: there is the warrant for the poſſeſſing and ſubduing of the earth by man. This in generall.</p>
                        <p>Particularly, that if man had continued in innocencie, there is none but in the ſtate of innocencie would have beene contented with that that is ſufficient: we ſhould not have beene troubled with our unruly appetites; for the earth would have beene ſufficient for all. But after the entring in of ſinne, it was neceſſary there ſhould be a diviſion: and ſo it pleaſed God. For though the occaſion hereof was evill, (for as good Lawes come out of an evill cauſe) as it was <hi>Cains</hi> perſecution of <hi>Abel,</hi> that made <hi>Seth</hi> to gather together. So that firſt incloſure, or impropriation of a City, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Caine</hi> choſe out a plot, and there he built a City, and called it after his ſonnes name. This gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Fathers and Patriarchs themſelves, ſeeing the uſurping of <hi>Cains</hi> government, and ſeeing the expediencie of it, in regard of well ordering of private poſſeſſions, it made them to doe the like. This is it, that <hi>Noah</hi> did preſently after the floud: ſo it beganne preſently after the floud. So it beganne <hi>jure primae occupationis,</hi> by right of the firſt poſſeſſing, or ſeiſing on it: by the right of <hi>prima occupatio:</hi> whether the allotting of <hi>Noah</hi> of the chiefe parts unto his three ſonnes: he gave <hi>Africa</hi> to <hi>Cham, Aſia</hi> to <hi>Sem,</hi> and <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Iapheth:</hi> or whether it were by conſent and agreement among themſelves; the former, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.31. the other, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13.9, 10, 11. It is ſaid there, that <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> agreed to part the Countrey betweene them: and <hi>Lot,</hi> though he were the younger, had the choyce. So then we ſee how matters ſtood at the firſt. <hi>Epictetus</hi> ſheweth it by a familiar Simile. Where a diſh is brought to the table, before it is cut up, it is ſaid to be common to all that ſit at the table: but after it is cut of, that every man hath ſhared his part, then <hi>quam quiſque occupavit partem,</hi> what part ſoever a man hath ſhared for himſelfe, it is no juſtice, or civility to take it off his trencher. So firſt, all the earth was mankinds, and then they divided it: as <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.24. <hi>Omnem locum quem calcaverit pes veſter,</hi> every place whereon the ſoles of your feete ſhall tread, I give it to you, it is yours. So it was <hi>pedis calcatio,</hi> or <hi>occupatio,</hi> the treading of the foote, or occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, that entitled every man to his firſt right.</p>
                        <p>And a ſecond right. There is a right in common, and right <hi>in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium,</hi> propriety: as right in common is <hi>prima occupatio,</hi> the firſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: when we ſeiſe upon a Countrey, in which no body is; or if it
<pb n="788" facs="tcp:48000:258"/>be <hi>terra derelicto,</hi> a land given over: whoſoever is <hi>primus occupatur,</hi> the firſt ſeiſor on it, hath the <hi>jus,</hi> right of it. And ſecondly, of things immovable, <hi>immobilium eſt praeſcriptio, mobilium uſurpatio,</hi> there is a preſcription of goods immovable, an uſurpation of the movable: and there are two very good reaſons for this: 1. Becauſe the Common-wealth doth marvellouſly reſpect <hi>terrenam pacem,</hi> mutuall outward peace: and doth looke to bloudſhed; and becauſe infinite quarrels might ariſe out of this, and men might forge evidences, therefore to cut off this, there is <hi>Praeſcriptio.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>But the ſecond hath more ſhew: The Common-wealth ſaith this: If any man neglect his owne right, (for that is our Maxime) <hi>intereſt reipublicae, ut quiſque re ſua recte utatur,</hi> the Common-wealth is to have a care, that every man uſe his goods aright: if he neglect them, that except the Common-wealth ſhould take order for them, they ſhould periſh; the Common-wealth taketh order to puniſh him for his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence: and ſaith, If he leave his ground without tilth ſo many yeares, till ſuch a preſcript time, he ſhall loſe it. And thus every one doth poſſeſſe his things, <hi>in communi jure,</hi> the common Law.</p>
                        <p>The <hi>jus proprium,</hi> the right of propriety, added to the ſecond mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that it is done <hi>ex jure belli,</hi> by the law of Armes: becauſe the Magiſtrate hath <hi>gladium exteriorem,</hi> he hath authority to puniſh any outward offence, and him that doth it: and ſo conſequently perſiſting in his obſtinacie, may caſt him out: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.22. The inheritance that <hi>Iacob</hi> gave to <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> he had gotten it of the Amorite by his ſword and bow; <hi>jure juſti belli,</hi> by a lawfull wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rre. Now this <hi>proprium jus,</hi> right of propriety, ariſeth thus. For after a man is thus ſeiſed on any thing, whether it be a publike poſſeſſion, or private, he taketh it in 4. rights.

<pb n="790" facs="tcp:48000:259"/>and meaſure. In his order thus: that whereas there be two things that a mans deſire is carried unto;
<list>
                              <item>1. The enjoying of the end it ſelfe.</item>
                              <item>2. Of thoſe meanes, <hi>quae tendunt ad finem,</hi> which conduce to the attaining of that end:</item>
                           </list> There muſt be (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) a diviſion out of the faculty, a double deſire, <hi>duplex amor,</hi> and double love, and double concupiſcence; becauſe there be two things, and one is greater then another; 1. wherewith we deſire the laſt fruition, and another whereby we ſeeme <hi>appetere,</hi> to long after that that doth further us to the end. Then whereas the end is greater, ſo the love of it muſt be <hi>prior &amp; major,</hi> both timelier and greater then the other love, of which the object of this is one.</p>
                        <p>Then this is that which we hold: firſt, that as in the miniſtring of medicine to the body, there is a certaine quantity and meaſure, which if it faile, it purgeth not all the humour; if it be more, it purgeth all the humour, and ſomewhat elſe, that it ſhould not purge: So in the affections and appetites of the ſoule, there is in ſome a deſire of theſe things, yet mixed with ſome defect: neglect then is no regard, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>And in other ſome, there is ſuch an exceſſive deſire, that either they are affected to worldly things more then they ſhould be; or ſo, that they can be content to forget their duty, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. hee ſaith hee would not have one to be as <hi>Eſau,</hi> to forget his birthright, his bleſſing that God beſtowed on him, for a meſſe of pottage, or meate: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is expedient that we take the meaſure it ſelfe firſt: and that we muſt beginne after this order, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <gap reason="foreign">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap>. <hi>And having foode and rtiment, let us be therewith content.</hi> A contented minde, that if it pleaſe God to beſtow no more on us, then theſe, yet we ſtand contented. The reaſon is, becauſe wee ſee that God hath created poore men and rich; as having plenty of ſpirit, ſo plenty of wealth, he might have made all rich: the reaſon that hindered this, was, as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, that as the rich might have <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium benignitatis,</hi> the recompence of their bounty, ſo that he might crowne the poore man, <hi>cum mercede patientiae.</hi> So ſaith <hi>Sol. Prov.</hi> 22.2. And therefore every man is to ſtand contented, if he will, to call him higher: adding no cares which may breed noyſome luſts; thus muſt he ſtand, becauſe it is Gods good will and pleaſure: and then 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.15. out of <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.18. he that gathereth much, hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing over; and he that gathereth a little, hath nothing leſſe, when he dieth: therefore making this the firſt part of meaſure, not to ſeeke to riſe otherwiſe then God will. And then ſecondly, that it is lawfull, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.8. to gather in Summer for the time that is to come, by honeſt meanes, and with a ſober minde. And then thirdly, that he ſeeth his houſhold increaſe (as when <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaw the Patriarchs increaſed in his houſe; <hi>Gen.</hi> 30.30. we ſee what care he tooke for them: When ſhall I travell for mine owne houſe, &amp;c. So this deſire and care he may have of them that pertaine to him, being alwayes limited with the former conditions: <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.15. that he may drinke out of his owne Ciſterns, <hi>i.</hi> that he may have of his owne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. that he may not be chargeable to others: and as <hi>Sol. ut habeat fonies, qui deriventur foras, us tamen juſte Dominus eorum ſit:</hi> the meaning is, that he may be libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="791" facs="tcp:48000:259"/>to others, and yet have to ſuffice himſelfe, that he may have to pay his <hi>ditrachma: Exod.</hi> 30.12. to helpe the Church, and <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.29. the Common-wealth, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.12. that he may have where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to do good to poore Saints: as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. to have for himſelfe, and to give to them that need. Thus far if the meanes be kept, and a ſober minde, the meaſure is kept. Now if he goe beyond this, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.10. then beginneth the roote of this; 1. he murmureth at another, in regard that he hath a better condition. <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.3. They would have tarried in <hi>Egypt</hi> ſtill: We will go to <hi>Egypt</hi> againe. They preferred the life in <hi>Egypt,</hi> before the life <hi>in deſerto,</hi> in the Wilderneſſe: Firſt, the life by the fleſh-pots, before Gods ſervice: And ſecondly, a diſquietneſſe alſo after that. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.31. <hi>Quid comedam? quid bibam? quid induam?</hi> what ſhall I eate? what ſhall I drink? wherewithall ſhall I be cloathed? And that care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe the rich have, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.17. the rich man reaſoneth with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: and ſo the third, out of theſe: it breedeth a neaſt of horſe-leaches, a worme with <hi>lingua biſulca,</hi> a forked tongue, crying <hi>Affer, affer: unde habeas nihil reſert, ſed oportet habere:</hi> bring, bring; it is no matter how, or whence you have it, for have it you muſt: upon theſe three ſtandeth this <hi>ſuppuratio concupiſcentiae,</hi> the Impoſtume of luſt.</p>
                        <p>Now for the making of <hi>ſubactum ſolum,</hi> of the ground and ſoile meete: as <hi>Tit.</hi> 2. the taking of an eſtate above our proportion, hee that will beare a bigger ſaile then he is able to carry, <hi>cui plus opus eſt,</hi> then he needeth, then he falleth unto unlawfull practiſes, then is hee a fit ſoile for the Devill to caſt in his ſeed; and he moveth him to ſtealth, and the provocation and allurement. <hi>Luke</hi> 15.13. he ſetteth downe, that the prodigall ſonne fell upon a riotous company of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, <hi>&amp; ſic diſſipavit ſuum patrimonium,</hi> and ſo waſted his ſubſtance: If a man follow ſuch company, it will ſet him <hi>ſupra analogiam,</hi> above his allowance. He muſt ſpend lawfully and orderly, and then as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.12. he will ſpeake as they ſpeake. 1. The breaking forth of this is <hi>in icterum,</hi> into a Jaundiſe: we have examples, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 21.2. of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habs</hi> eye: becauſe he ſaw a thing that ſerved for his turne, though hee had enough; he could never be well till he had it: and when he could not by right, he got it by wrong, and by the bloud of an innocent man. And the foamings out at the mouth, there be many ſet downe by the Heathen man, and <hi>Menander</hi> is full, to that purpoſe out of the booke of the Preacher, and of <hi>Wiſdome.</hi> If a man had an inheritance with wiſdome, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.11.12.4. The ſhadow of wiſdome is good, but the ſhadow of money will doe well. Then ſucceedeth the Act.</p>
                        <p>Now to the act of thoft, reducing all theſe uſes that we ſaid were lawfull, to theſe that are common among Lawyers.
<list>

                        <p>Then the next after is as good, but yet not anſwerable in wares: for in wares, that they be good; firſt they conſider the ſubſtance of them, that they be not <hi>quiſquiliae frugum,</hi> the refuſe of the corne: <hi>Amos</hi> 8.6. <hi>Eſa.</hi> 1.22. mingled with ſubſtance: to mingle wine with water, is a corrupting of the wares: ſo if in ſubſtance, they are falſe, or mingled, they are naught.</p>

And becauſe the unfaithfulneſſe and untruſtineſſe of man hath brought in writings, as Bils and Obligations, and pledges, and ſureties, &amp;c. therefore, even for them alſo hath God taken order in his word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15.4.

                        <p>So the ſurety, ſeeing <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26. it was ſuch a dangerous thing to become ſurety: and that the law was ſo ſtrict, Spare him not: and that the world was now growne to make it a rule, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.16. to take the pledge of him that is ſurety, and let the other goe: therefore he ſaith <hi>Prov.</hi> 6. <hi>verſ.</hi> 4.

                           </note>For the accuſer, the breach of this office in this behalfe is three wayes. 1. <hi>Calumnia,</hi> ſlander, when he doth <hi>calumniari,</hi> ſlander; as <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> doth, <hi>Eſter</hi> 3.8. for he ſaith there, that the people of the Jewes had lawes diverſe from other Lawes; &amp; they had not been obſervers of the Kings Lawes, and the King, he falleth into his <hi>temerarium judicium,</hi> his raſh judgement too, <hi>i.</hi> when he heareth a falſe accuſation againſt it.</p>
                        <p>And the next, when a man proceedeth upon uncertainty; as <hi>Acts</hi> 24.13. thoſe that did accuſe <hi>Paul,</hi> alleadged many things,<note place="margin">1. Proceeding upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</note> but they could not prove any thing. So he is to wait till he have his full proofe.</p>
                        <p>Now the third is <hi>Praevaricatio,</hi> prevarication, or colluſion in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: a metaphore taken from <hi>(vari)</hi> thoſe that have their knees out of joynt, and the convulſion is inward, ſo that both touch above,<note place="margin">

For in the ancient common-wealths, when as they wore long garments, a man might eaſily have beene de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, thinking them to be as broad at the knees, as at the feete: ſo they that ſtrive together, whereas they are friends privily, thoſe are called <hi>praevaricatores,</hi> prevaricators, or accuſers; when a man doth accuſe, and yet his friend with him whom he doth accuſe: and it is nothing elſe but a mockery of the place of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And <hi>Advocatus actoris,</hi> the Advocate for the Plaintiffe: he that repreſenteth the party, he is ſo charged with the ſame prevarication, the betraying of the truth with weake proofes and grounds: thoſe that betray the cauſe with weake defences. <hi>Ezra.</hi> 4.5. it is ſaid, that they were hired, <hi>i.</hi> there were men about <hi>Artaxerxes,</hi> that bare the face of ſuch as would adviſe him of that that was beſt for him: whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they had taken a bribe againſt the Jewes before. That party that is to ſuſtaine one perſon, and is corrupted to doe the contrary, he is to be blamed for his prevarication.</p>
                        <p>Now for the Defendant, or him that is accuſed,<note place="margin">Defendant.</note> there are three other.</p>
                        <p>The firſt is, if being according to the forme of Law by <hi>Ioſhuah</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.4. that he doe not <hi>verſare ſe ad agitandum acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones,</hi> practiſe himſelfe to turne off the ſuite commenced againſt him,
<pb n="832" facs="tcp:48000:280"/>or which is as old, <hi>ad accuſandas excuſationes,</hi> to accuſe other, that he may excuſe himſelfe; it was <hi>Adams</hi> fault, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. <hi>tergiverſatio,</hi> tergi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: the queſtion was, whether he had eaten or not? he anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not to it; but ſaid, <hi>the woman which thou gaveſt me, &amp;c. Iob</hi> 31.33. This he ſaith of himſelfe, If I have hid my ſinne as <hi>Adam</hi> did, concealing mine iniquity in my boſome: though I could have made afraid a great multitude; yet if I made a fault, I confeſſed it. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lawfully commanded, we muſt confeſſe: ſo we muſt not adde evill to evill. To be evill is evill: <hi>&amp; videri malum,</hi> and to ſeeme evill is evill too. And ſo a man is not bound to open himſelfe without the ſeate of judgement; and ſo, where there is not a lawfull courſe ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.20.21. he ſaith to them directly, They had heard of him. And if any man would accuſe him, let him come forth. And as he there uſed indirect words; ſo he himſelfe practiſed, <hi>Iohn</hi> 19.9. to <hi>Pilates</hi> queſtions he ſaid nothing, becauſe they did not proceed <hi>ex publica infamia,</hi> or <hi>ex ſemiplena probatione,</hi> of publike infamy (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhould be, common fame) or probable grounds, or likely proofes: but onely he queſtioned with him, to ſee if he would accuſe himſelfe. So in theſe caſes, a man may anſwer nothing; for if it be a truth, as <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 23.6. if there be two things, and both true, a man may anſwer one truth, and <hi>occultare pariem veritatis,</hi> and hide a part of the other truth: as he did; that foraſmuch as the councell was divided, and the Phariſees held the Reſurrection; he ſaid he was judged for that, though it was not for that alone, that he was judged for. So if a man have divers wayes to defend himſelfe, he may chuſe one which he will: or if they proceed not aright, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But if according to the forme of Law there be proceeding, made of that he is accuſed of, he is bound, <hi>Ioſh.</hi> 7.19. to anſwer; this is one.</p>
                        <p>And the ſecond is, that whereas there is given for a remedy of thoſe that are oppreſſed, the benefit of Appeale: yet for a man to protract in an evill cauſe, to ſue Appeales, that need not, is a ſecond fault: and againſt that <hi>Exod.</hi> 18.22.23. to make delaies of juſtice, and when he hath received ſentence, to refuſe it: <hi>reſiſt it ordinationi,</hi> and not obey their orders: <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Qui ordinationi reſiſtit, Deo reſiſtit,</hi> whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſiſteth the ordinance, reſiſteth God.</p>
                        <p>For Witneſſes,<note place="margin">Witneſſes.</note> there are three other. The 1. is <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.5. If a man being lawfully required by his ſuperiour according to the proofe, demanding his witneſſe, if it be not in matters out of queſtion, hee is bound to tell whatſoever he hath heard. And if it be not a ſuperiour, yet if it be for the delivery of a man; and if it be a matter, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24. that doth concerne the delivery of the ſoule, he is bound to anſwer: ſo ſaith he, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.11.12. he ſpeaketh of thoſe that will not deliver them that are drawne to death: If hee ſay, I cannot ſay ſo much as I would, and I know not of it, &amp;c. he counteth it a great fault for a man, for the preſervation of an innocent, not to give teſtimony, though it be not required by authority.</p>
                        <p>But otherwiſe, if it be out of theſe, if the ſuperiour require not for condemnation; on the other ſide, if he require matters out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
<pb n="833" facs="tcp:48000:280"/>or if it be not in the caſe of deliverance, he is not bound to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. And as theſe 2. cauſes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.21. he ſetteth downe another way for wicked perſons: The Greekes proverbe is, <hi>Da mihi mutuum juſjurandum,</hi> lend me an oath: Our Saviour Chriſt calleth it,<note place="margin">Lend an Oath. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.21. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.5.</note> a joyning in hand in hand: The wiſe man he ſaith plainly, though that they may happily eſcape the hands of men, yet they ſhall not eſcape unpuniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: that is, God will be ſure to puniſh them.</p>
                        <p>For the Advocate, there are two wayes appointed to him. Firſt,<note place="margin">Advocate</note> if he take an evill cauſe in hand; which ſo as man to doe, he knowing it not, is a great ſinne. For <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.1.2. he ſaith there, you ſhall not report for your witneſſe: and then for him that helpeth him, Thou ſhalt not helpe him in his Plea.</p>
                        <p>2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.2. <hi>Iehu</hi> ſaid to <hi>Iehoſophat,</hi> Wilt thou helpe the wicked, and love them that hate God? And we ſee, he withdrew himſelfe: for as it is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. he ſaith, not onely the doer of wicked things, but <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p n="2">2. And the other is ſet downe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.23. that is, when a man for the defence of a cauſe indifferent, doth wreſt the Law, or take a gift out of the boſome to helpe a cauſe in judgement, that might be carried otherwiſe: yet it is condemned, <hi>Prov.</hi> 24.24. to ſay to the wicked, thou art juſt, to joyne with the wicked to helpe a wicked cauſe; or if it be not, yet by wrong meanes to ſeeke a bolſter for it, ſo is the courſe of judgement.</p>

So whether a man doth it to bring into danger, or out of credit; the wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.22. of him that is a talebearer, his words are as flatterings, and they goe downe into the bowels of the belly. <hi>Bernard</hi> in his 24. upon the <hi>Cantic.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Video magna prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitti ſuſpiria,</hi> you ſhall have him ſend before great and deepe ſighes, and he will ſpeake <hi>tanquam contuſus, ſicque cum quadam tarditate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsis ſuperciliis, voce plangenti, &amp;c. ſic egreditur maledictio,</hi> as if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and aſhamed, and then with an affected flowneſſe, caſting downe his countenance, with a mournfull voyce: and there commeth out the curſed venom of the heart.

                        <p>As in reſpect of exceſſe, your ſlanderous tongue either plainely, or under cover is often ſeene; ſo on the other ſide, becauſe men are joyned by the law of charity, <hi>Iames</hi> 3.2.

So we ſee it is a way to repentance: therefore for this, to make them repent, were to performe this duty: and when we have performed it, not to repent us of it: And ſo is the reaſon of the ſpeech to be underſtood, <hi>Non amo quenquam, niſi offende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro,</hi> I love not any, till I have made him ſadde: and making him ſadde, he hath had the effect of amendment.</p>
                        <p>Now there are others againſt this, that ſay, that as the former Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement is mixt of frugality againſt prodigality; and of liberality againſt covetouſneſſe; ſo here in this Commandement, the one is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving againſt flattery, and the other giving a true charitable report againſt detraction.

And in good things, that there bee not haſte: but as God would aske the cauſe, though he knew it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.9. to teach us to doe ſo before we judge: neither muſt we report the truth, <hi>lingua prodigâ,</hi> with a laviſh tongue: but as he <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.9. cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth himſelfe the Publican; whereas others called him not ſo; but the ſonne of <hi>Alpheus:</hi> and he ſetteth not downe his owne liberality, which is ſet downe, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.29. <hi>Marke</hi> 14.71. (which <hi>Peter</hi> is thought to have penned) ſetteth downe <hi>Peters</hi> abnegation moſt plainely; I know not this man: whereas the other have, I know not the man. So that the rule is here, that we ſay the worſt of our ſelves, and the beſt of others: ſo we muſt behave our ſelves in our good or evill, againſt hearing: the countenance, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.45. we ſhall be as deafe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to the hearing of evill, as evill are to the good, reports augment it: as <hi>Doeg,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.20. he gave but bread, and he told it was victuals: ſo did the falſe ſpies augment the ſtrength of the Countrey, <hi>Numb.</hi> 13.32. as we may ſay by them which report truely. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. Flattery, <hi>mellea ſtrangulatio,</hi> is but as the choaking of one with honey: Againſt that of himſelfe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.4. To keepe himſelfe low, and not to hate others that ſpeake againſt, as did <hi>Achabs</hi> ſuſpition. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. conſider that they condemne themſelves: therefore 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.31. Look to themſelves; which will make them ſay, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 51.7. feare it not, but
<pb n="844" facs="tcp:48000:286"/>eſteeme the witneſſe of our owne conſcience, and the witneſſe of God, more then mans witneſſe. But if it be in a knowne thing, wherefore we are committed, then take heede of a brazen face, to ſet our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it without ſhame, and not to feare the puniſhment; for that will laſt but nine daies: but to have a confuſion in our mindes, and wiſh againe to be in the favour of God, and his Saints.</p>
                        <p n="2">2. In unknown things, ſeeing no body can prove ought: and not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegendum peccatum, niſi ſine peccato id fieri poſsit:</hi> a ſecret ſinne is not to be diſcovered, unleſſe it can be done without giving offence or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall: yet with <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.4. we muſt ſay to God, <hi>Tibi ſoli pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi,</hi> againſt thee onely have I ſinned. And this ſuſpition, if we have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven any by ſuſpitiouſly behaving our ſelves in any ſinne, wee muſt thinke it Gods goodneſſe to put us in minde, that we wander not in error, and delight in it.</p>
                        <p>If we never give occaſion of it, but alwayes deteſted it, yet becauſe we may fall into it by negligence, this may be a warning: as many fall into theſe ſinnes, by not taking heed, which before they have moſt hated: ſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.14. <hi>bonum eſt timere omnia,</hi> happy is the man that feareth alwayes.</p>
                        <p>When therefore this ſinne commeth, we muſt conſider whether we have ever ſaid to God, as they doe, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 10.15. heare us but this once, and we will ſerve thee: or <hi>Hoſe.</hi> 7.13.14. in our ſickneſſe promiſe more obedience after health reſtored, and yet with this in the Iſraelites, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.36. lie unto God: And therefore juſtly they that doe this, lie alſo unto men; and therefore the Vineyard ſhall lie unto them. And when they depart from the truth, for mighty men looking for helpe of them: thoſe axiomes ſhall deceive them, and it ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
                        <p>The laſt rule, to procure this to others: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.6. <hi>veraces terrae,</hi> the faithfull of the Land ſhall be his, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 7. The lier ſhall not tarry in his ſight. And thus much of the ninth Commandement.</p>

                           </list> If there be agreement betwixt theſe, then are we witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the truth: for as <hi>veritas oris,</hi> truth is in the mouth, if the ſpeech and heart goe together: ſo is <hi>veritas vitae,</hi> truth in our life, if it be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the word, which is <hi>ſignum ejus rei, quae menie ſignata eſt,</hi> the ſigne and fruit of that thing which is ſealed up in the minde: which is plaine by Chriſts aſſertion, <hi>By their fruits yee ſhall know them: Mat.</hi> 7. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.36. the Scribes require a ſigne from Heaven to teſtifie to them the greatneſſe of Chriſts power.</p>
                        <p>And workes, and not onely words, but deeds may be called, <hi>ſigna ejus rei quae in mente eſt,</hi> ſignes of ſuch things as are in the minde. This alſo is manifeſt by common experience: For we ſee not onely by precept and ſpeech, but alſo by example and action, good and hurt done: therefore we muſt expreſſe the truth as well in action as in word: &amp; avoid ſimulation in both: which oppoſite in this place, for this cauſe God taketh order, that neither in deede nor in word men ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit to be, that which they are not.</p>
                        <p>Notwithſtanding, as before, a man may lawfully <hi>occultare partem veritatis in dictis,</hi> conceale a part of the truth in his diſcourſe: ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,

                        <p>Alſo there may be <hi>ſignificatio ejus quod deeſt,</hi> an intimation and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of what is wanting.</p>
                        <p>As he is not bound to tell that forth in word, which he knoweth, ſo neither is he bound by conſcience to utter that by countenance which he knoweth. Otherwiſe, in time of warre, to oppoſe our ſelves to ſuch as reſiſt the truth, a man may with <hi>Ioſua</hi> 8.15. <hi>ſimulare fugam,</hi> make as if they fled.</p>
                        <p>As alſo for triall, as our Saviour Chriſt did, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.28. he made as though he would have gone further, if intreaty had not ſtayed him: and it is plaine by <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.20.</p>
                        <p>A principall part of this vice, is hypocriſie, which is an outward reſemblance, or cloke of religion, without any ground of it in the heart: of this we have ſpoken heretofore, we will therefore paſſe it over: and come to that which the Prophet hath, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 26.4. hee ſaith he hath not kept company with vaine perſons.</p>

By which two places it is manifeſt, that vanity brings lies, and with them the catalogue of thoſe ſinnes that belong unto this Commandement. As wantonneſſe is forbidden in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, and ſuperfluity in the eighth Commandement: ſo here vanity of ſpeech. Concerning which <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.8. he maketh it an eſpeciall part of a wicked man: And <hi>Eſa.</hi> 59.4. they truſt in vanity, which is
<pb n="850" facs="tcp:48000:289"/>the firſt ſtep to lies: and they proceed further to iniquity. <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 26.4. glorieth that he had not kept company with diſſemblers, and vaine men, or as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.6. among ſuch as toſſe vanity like a Tennis-ball. Such as make queſtions, and receive as vaine anſwers, and reply againe as vainely. And this <hi>Iob.</hi> 31.5. by the light of nature ſaw among the reſt; that this was one thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his conſcience bare him witneſſe, that he was free, that hee had not walked in vanity, which is good for no uſe. And then as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith well upon <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. what workeman is there, that will have any toole, that will ſerve him to no uſe? and therefore he concludeth, that this <hi>ars animarum,</hi> this art of ſaving of ſoules, being <hi>ars artium, &amp; ſcientia ſcientiarum,</hi> the Art of Arts, and Science of Sciences: there muſt not be any thing in it belonging to vanity. And hereupon the Fathers ſay, that <hi>Quicquid eſt ocioſum, eſt criminoſum,</hi> whatſoever is idle is ſinfull. For this cauſe the Apoſtle bids us ſtay fooliſh queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.8.9. and his reaſon is, becauſe they be vaine. Now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the major propoſition be this, which muſt be generall, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is vaine, is to be avoided: it were no ſyllogiſme.</p>
                        <p>And we ſee this is to be avoided: ſo there is in us, ſaith the holy Ghoſt, an untowardneſſe, as is <hi>pullus onagri,</hi> the wild Aſſes colt: ſo is man from his youth.<note place="margin">A forge of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</note> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4. For as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, there is a forge of idle thoughts, which bring forth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.17. vaine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; therefore we muſt in the beginning take heede of this, that we will not as the Gentiles doe, that we lift not up our heads to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                        <p>He will have our converſation to be to edification, that God may have praiſe, our neighbour may be built up in his knowledge and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by our example. If not this, then a ſecond, that there be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary uſe of it: or if not that, yet it muſt be ſuch, as may give grace to the hearer. And if we will take <hi>Paul</hi> for example, we may beſt learn <hi>ex verbis ejus in Epiſtolis,</hi> from his owne words in his Epiſtles, what his ſpeech was. For we doubt not but he ſhewed himſelfe like in his common ſpeech.</p>
                        <p>For the firſt, we know his examples are plentifully to edification, That we may doe it <hi>ad neceſſitatem,</hi> for our neceſſary uſe: it is manifeſt by 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.23. he bids him for the health of the body, drinke wine, which no man will ſay, was done <hi>ad aedificationem,</hi> but <hi>ad juſtam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitatem,</hi> to edification, but yet it was done upon juſt and neceſſary grounds.</p>
                        <p>Thirdly, if not this, yet that, whereas he bade him bring the cloak which he left at <hi>Troas,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. &amp;c. and ſo <hi>verſ.</hi> 20. he ſaith, <hi>Eraſtus</hi> abode at <hi>Corinthus, Trophimus</hi> I left at <hi>Miletum</hi> ſicke: which doe not directly ſerve to edification, though indirectly it doe all other things.</p>
                        <p>And therefore thoſe narrations which concerne a man to know, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not things of neceſſary uſe, take a ſecond place: for <gap reason="foreign">

                           </gap>, ſalutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, this is a third: whither <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. wholly, may be reduced. Now in theſe Salutations there is no edification, nor yet juſt neceſſity; for
<pb n="851" facs="tcp:48000:289"/>in divers examples they are omitted: but they ſerve to encreaſe love and ſavour among men.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. he exhorts every man, that his ſpeech be powdered with Salt: not with ſcurriſity and profane urbanity, <hi>non nigro ſale Momi, ſed can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                                 <desc>••</desc>

                        <p>To this end ſerveth that 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. where he ſaith, I have not beene chargeable to any of you. I pray you forgive me this wrong. Surely there was no cauſe why he ſhould crave pardon for this fault: but no doubt this pierced deeper then if he had uttered it in direct words and termes. Now, but that grace muſt concurre with edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.3. a fruitfull ſpeech, and profitable to edification; and none in the world could have expreſſed it more wittily: and <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. he calleth the circumciſion, conciſion. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4. The Apoſtle diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth us from fooliſh talking, and exhorteth us to thankſgiving: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Hereticks called <hi>fratricelli,</hi> the poore humble brethren, would have no word in anſwering, but <hi>laudate Deum,</hi> praiſe God. Who, when they were demanded any queſtion, ſaid alwayes, <hi>laudate Chriſtum,</hi> praiſe Chriſt. But the old Church underſtood well enough, <hi>per me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonym. effecti,</hi> by a metonymy of the effect, thankſgiving for that which was thankworthy.</p>
                        <p>Then whatſoever ſpeech it is, that may be brought to one of theſe three kindes, is not evill, but good. Albeit that that which is lawfull be not kept, for we are to ſtrive after the beſt things: that is, that it may be done <hi>ad aedificationem,</hi> to edification: ſo that though theſe terrene conſolations, theſe pety comforts be lawfull; yet exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Pſalmes and ſpirituall ſongs are better. Yet theſe are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull, but expedient, and likewiſe neceſſary. And thus much of the actuall offences of this Commandement. For the obedience hereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, how we are to behave our ſelves toward our ſelves, we are to learne theſe few precepts.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That we may learne out of <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.9. the Prophet ſaith there, The children of men are deceitfull upon the weights; that is, they are too light. This is that beginning indeed. For it is vanity by which he hath the firſt vantage upon a man: and therefore he muſt learne and labour to be ſtedfaſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.5.8. he muſt be ſo grounded that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little ſuſpition will not put him out of tune: for if he want this, every vanity in reſpect of himſelfe, and every affection toward his neighbour, will ſet him out of the way.</p>
                        <p>For ſuſpition is one of the fruits of concupiſcence, and the riſing of it is a thing that cannot be reſiſted: but the <hi>principium,</hi> beginning of it muſt be ſuppreſſed, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.4.</p>
                        <p>The firſt uſe of this ſuſpition, was to procure our ſafety: and to preſerve our ſoules: therefore, for the ſafegard of our owne lives and ſoules, it is better to be <hi>nimium timidus, quam parum prudens,</hi> it is better to be ſolicitouſly fearfull, then ſecurely improvident. We have the example and practiſe of it in <hi>Paul,</hi> he ſuſpected the
<pb n="852" facs="tcp:48000:290"/>worſt, and yet the truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.30.</p>
                        <p>Now, when theſe things, given us for helpe of our ſelves and others, are turned to the hurt and detriment of our ſelves and others; this muſt be a great ſinne, wherewithall even the Godly may bee at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted, but there is a difference. For though the they ariſe, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 13.19. when Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Iudas, quod facis, fac cito,</hi> what thou doeſt, doe ſpeedily, there was ſuſpition in the hearts of the Apoſtles: ſome thought he bade him buy ſuch things as he ſtood in need of, againſt the feaſt; other, that he ſhould give ſomething to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.11. Theſe ſuſpitions prevailed ſo fame in the Galatians, even beyond poſitive ſuſpition, that he ſaid, <hi>metuo ne ſruſtra laborave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,</hi> I am afraid, leaſt I have laboured in vaine.</p>
                        <p>They prevailed to diminiſh his opinion of them, and yet <hi>poſſeſſivam ſuſpicionem,</hi> a poſitive or poſſeſſive ſuſpition had the Apoſtle of them that his paines were not ſo fruitfull as they might have been.

If hee had not beene a ſinner, he would have knowne who, and what manner wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, &amp;c. but he anſwered quickly, and he was reproved.

                        <p>Six things to be noted in the concluſions, they reduce them to foure heads.</p>
                        <p n="1">1. That it is moſt naturall to ſuſpition to ariſe upon a ſlender ground.

<pb n="853" facs="tcp:48000:290"/>of <hi>Galile</hi> will make him a Diſciple of Chriſt. But let every man when he is tried with a ſuſpition, trie the ground.</p>
                        <p>From this they come to the object: ſundry things pertaine to God, which men will ſcanne, and make concluſions of it; whereas <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, God onely knoweth the ſecret of thoughts. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.30. Yet we muſt be concluding that men thought thus and thus: even of their meaning.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.4. is moſt fitly applied to this, <hi>Quis in es qui ſervum judicas al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <p>The ſecond thing, the condition in which men live: in whom wee will be judging of the ſecret judgements and predeſtination of God: ſo that if we ſee any man fall into ſickneſſe, or any other calamity, wee ſtraight conclude that he is a wicked man, a murderer, with the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: although the <hi>Preacher</hi> 9.2. ſaith, All things come alike to all, &amp;c. In thoſe kindes of ſuſpitions ye have one thing not to doe, not to ſuſpect. <hi>Iohn</hi> 9.2. For neither was it the father of him that was borne blinde, that had ſinned, neither yet he that was borne blinde. This was a concluſion of Chriſts Diſciples, That either hee or his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt needs be a ſinner: whereas indeed the judgements of God are <hi>abyſſus,</hi> a great deep, and cannot be ſearched.</p>
                        <p>Or elſe we enter into the ſecret counſell of God: ſaying, as <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. <hi>vanus eſt qui ſervit Domino,</hi> it is in vaine to ſerve the Lord: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> and others have loſt their lives for ſerving of God.</p>
                        <p>The third is concerning things to come. They will affirme if a man be caſt downe once, and forſaken of God, he can never recover againe. Whereas we ought 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. to enſtruct them with the ſpirit of meekeneſſe. And then ſo we come to give oftentimes fooliſh, raſh, and prepoſterous judgements of good men: not knowing that <hi>multi ſunt intus Lupi, multi etiam ſunt Oves ſoris, &amp;c.</hi> many Wolves are within, and many Sheepe alſo without. And theſe are Gods matters, and are to be judged by him, and not of us; for his hand is long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough.</p>
                        <p>The fourth thing is in matters pertaining to men.</p>
                        <p>Sometime we judge of an

                        <p>When it comes to the judgement of the perſon, it is not ſo, for the perſon may be hurt by my judgement. For if either I make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, or of leſſe credit, when he doth not diſcerne it, I offend grievouſly. If I hurt him by judging him, I doe him injury. If I doe not impaire his credit, or good name, I doe not if I judge well, &amp;c.</p>
                        <p>But if thus againe, when it groweth not to determination, but to ſuppoſition, we muſt ſuppoſe the worſt that may be: for if I miniſter
<pb n="854" facs="tcp:48000:291"/>a medicine unto a ſinne, not ſtrong enough to take away the ſinne, I rather increaſe it. If it be too forcible, I ſhall be ſure to take it away, which is the leſſe.</p>

                        <p>Sometime in a matter knowne, when we are convicted for it, we muſt take heede of the forehead of an Harlot: if the diſcipline of the Church will doe no good, it is a dangerous caſe: for we ſee how few come to repentance by the civill policie.

                           <p>Upon which points, the Doctrine that is to be delivered out of this Scripture doth follow by good conſequence, for of theſe points of <hi>holding faſt our faith in Chriſt,</hi> two queſtions may ariſe, which may be anſwered by the Apoſtles words in this place, where it may be demanded, Firſt, <hi>Whether we be able of our owne ſtrength to ſhew forth that diligence that is required to aſſure us of our hope.</hi> The Apoſtle reſolveth us of that doubt in ſaying, <hi>We are not able of our ſelves to thinke any good as of our ſelves.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, becauſe it may be objected, <hi>If we be not able of our ſelves, from whence then may we receive abilitie?</hi> he addeth, <hi>that our ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencie is of God,</hi> from whoſe goodneſſe it commeth, that we are able to do any good thing whatſoever: to the end that when God ſtands without, <hi>knocking at the doore of our hearts, Rom.</hi> 3. for the performance of ſuch duties as pleaſe him, we, in regard that of our ſelves we cannot do the leaſt thing that he requireth, ſhould knocke
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48000:293"/>at the gate of his mercy, that he will miniſter to us ability to do the ſame, according to his promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. <hi>Knocke and it ſhall be opened to you.</hi> That as by the preaching of the Law there was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us the <hi>doore of faith, Act.</hi> 14. And as the <hi>Creed</hi> is unto us <hi>a doore of hope, Hoſ.</hi> 2.15. So the conſideration of our owne inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie might open unto us a doore unto prayer, by which we may ſue unto God for that ability which we have not of our ſelves. So this Scripture hath two uſes, firſt, to preſerve us from errour, that we ſeeke not for that in our ſelves, which cannot be found in us: ſecondly, for our direction, that ſeing all ability commeth from God, we ſhould ſeek for it, where it is to be found.</p>
                           <p>Both theſe things are matter very neceſſary to be knowne; the firſt ſerveth to exclude our boaſting, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. <hi>We ought not to boaſt of our ability, becauſe we have none.</hi> The ſecond is a meanes to provoke us to call upon God by prayer, that from him we may receive that which is wanting in our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>To ſpeake firſt of the negative part, both Heathen, and holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings do commend to us that ſaying, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Which as Heathen Philoſophers will us to conſider the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vertues wherewith mans nature is endued, the Scriptures all along put us in mind of our inſufficiencie, and tell us, <hi>That if any man ſeeme to himſelfe to be ſomething, when he is nothing, hee decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth himſelfe in his owne fancie, Galat.</hi> 6.3. <hi>And if any man think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that hee knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2.</p>
                           <p>Amongſt the places of Scripture, which the Holy Ghoſt uſeth to ſhew our inſufficiencie, none doth ſo much diſable our nature as this place of the Apoſtle, which denieth unto us all power ever to conceive a good thought, ſo farre are we off from fulfilling that good which we ought.</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48000:293"/>us, doth plainly ſhew, what is our imperfection.</p>
                           <p>The firſt thing to be obſerved in undertaking any good, is the <hi>accompliſhing</hi> of it: ſecondly, the <hi>working,</hi> or <hi>doing</hi> of the thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired: thirdly, the <hi>beginning</hi> to do it: fourthly, to <hi>ſpeake</hi> that which is good: fifthly, to <hi>will,</hi> and <hi>deſire</hi> it: ſixthly, to <hi>underſtand:</hi> ſeventhly, to <hi>thinke.</hi> But the Scripture doth deny all theſe unto us. The <hi>perfecting,</hi> or <hi>bringing to paſſe</hi> of that which is good, is not in our ſelves. <hi>To will is preſent with us, Sed bonum perficere non inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nio, Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Deus eſt, &amp;c. It is God which enableth us to performe, Phil.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                           <p>This we find by experience to be true, in things that are evill. The brethren of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> when they ſold him to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> had a purpoſe to worke their brothers hurt, but they had no power to <hi>performe</hi> their wicked attempts; <hi>For God turned their wicked purpoſe to good, Gen.</hi> 50.20. When <hi>Paul</hi> was going to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to perſecute the Church, it pleaſed God in the way to ſtay his purpoſe, ſo that he could not <hi>performe</hi> that evill which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, <hi>Act.</hi> 9.9. Thus much the Wiſeman ſheweth, when by an example he proveth, <hi>That the ſtrongeſt doth not alwaies carrie away the battell, Eccl.</hi> 9.13.</p>
                           <p>The Heathen themſelves ſay, that heroicall vertues are in the mind of man, but if any ſingular thing be done, it is the gods that give that power: and the <hi>Pelagian</hi> ſaith, though we be able to <hi>begin</hi> a good worke; yet the <hi>accompliſhment</hi> is of God.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we are not able, <hi>facere,</hi> no more then we were able to <hi>effect,</hi> for ſo ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Sine me nihil poteſtis facere.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith, <hi>Scio quod viri, non eſt via ejus, Jer.</hi> 10.23. If it be not in mans power, to order his way, and to rule his owne ſteps, much leſſe is he able to hold out to his journeyes end, but it is God that <hi>ordereth and directeth mans ſteps,</hi> Prov. 16.9. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The good I would do I do not, Rom.</hi> 7.17. And if we do any good, that it be not effected; yet it is the worke of God in us, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet confeſſeth. <hi>Domine, omnia opera noſtra operatus es in nobis, Eſay</hi> 26.12.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the <hi>inchoation,</hi> or <hi>beginning</hi> of that which is good is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed us, though we purpoſe in our hearts to performe thoſe duties of godlineſſe that are required, yet we have not the power to put them in practiſe. <hi>Filii venerunt ad partum, &amp; non ſunt vires pariendi, Eſay</hi> 37. <hi>The children are come unto the birth, and there is no ſtrength to bring forth.</hi> If we <hi>begin</hi> to do any good thing, it is, <hi>Deus qui coepit in nobis bonum opus, Phil.</hi> 1.6. In conſideration of which place, <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi> ſaith of the Pelagians, <hi>Audiant qui dicunt, à nobis eſſe coeptum, à Deo eſſe eventum.</hi> Here let them learne of the Apoſtle, that it is the Lord that doth <hi>begin,</hi> and <hi>performe</hi> the good worke.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the power to <hi>ſpeake</hi> that which is good is not in us, for as the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>A man may well purpoſe a thing in his heart, but the anſwer of the tongue commeth from the Lord, Prov.</hi> 16.1. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have often experience. They that have the office of teaching in the Church, albeit they do before-hand prepare what to ſay,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48000:294"/>yet when it comes to the point, are not able to deliver their mind in ſuch ſort, as they had purpoſed: as on the other ſide, when God doth aſſiſt them with his ſpirit, they are inabled on a ſudden to deliver that which they had not intended to ſpeake.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, as the ability of <hi>effecting</hi> was attributed to God, ſo is the <hi>will, Phil.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, for <hi>underſtanding</hi> the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The naturall man perceiveth not the things that are of the ſpirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. <hi>For the wiſedome of the fleſh is enmity with God, Rom.</hi> 8.7.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, the power of <hi>thinking</hi> the thing that is pleaſing to God, is not in us, ſo farre are we from <hi>underſtanding</hi> or <hi>deſiring</hi> it, as the Apoſtle in this place teſtifieth. And therefore where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaketh generally of all men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. <hi>The Lord knoweth the thoughts of men, that they are but vaine;</hi> the Apoſtle affirmeth that to be true, of the wiſe men of the world, that are endued onely with the wiſedome of the world, and the fleſh, that <hi>their thoughts are vaine alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.19, 20.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that we ſhould not thinke, that the want of abilitie ſtandeth onely in matters of difficulty and weight, the Apoſtle ſaith not, we are unable to thinke any <hi>weighty thing,</hi> but even, that without the ſpeciall grace of Gods ſpirit, we cannot thinke <hi>any thing.</hi> So <hi>Auguſtine</hi> underſtandeth Chriſts words, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. where he ſaith not, <hi>Nihil magnum &amp; difficile;</hi> but, <hi>ſine me nihil poteſtis facere.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is true in naturall things, for we are not able to prolong our owne life, one moment; the actions of our life are not of our ſelves, but from God, in whom we <hi>live, move, and have our beeing, Act.</hi> 17. Therefore upon thoſe words of Chriſts: <hi>Ego à meipſo non poſſum facere quicquam, niſi quod video Patrem, I of my ſelfe can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but what I ſee my Father doe, &amp;c. Joh.</hi> 5.9. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ei tribuit quicquid fecit, à quo eſt ipſe qui facit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>But the inſufficiencie of which the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, is not in things naturall, but in the miniſtration of the Spirit: So he ſaith, that <hi>God of his ſpeciall grace hath made them able Miniſters of the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, not of the letter, but of the ſpirit;</hi> his meaning is, that no endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of men can endue us with the grace of repentance, with <hi>faith, hope,</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian charity,</hi> except the inward working of Gods ſpirit.</p>
                           <p>As the Apoſtle ſpeakes of the <hi>gift of tongues,</hi> of the <hi>underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſecrets,</hi> and of <hi>all knowledge without charity; Nihil miht pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. So all our endeavours are unprofitable to us, unleſſe God by his ſpirit do co-operate with us, for, <hi>He that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, Joh.</hi> 15.5. that is, <hi>the fruit of righteouſneſſe, the end whereof is eternall life, Rom.</hi> 6.22.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the perſons whom he chargeth with this want of ability, are not the common ſort of <hi>naturall men,</hi> that are not yet <hi>regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate by Gods ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. but he ſpeakes of himſelfe, and his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-Apoſtles. So theſe words are an anſwer to that queſtion, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>; <hi>unto theſe things who is ſufficient?</hi> he anſwereth himſelfe, <hi>Not we, for we are not able of our ſelves to think a good thought,</hi> much leſſe are we fit of <hi>our ſelves,</hi> to be meanes, by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48000:294"/>whom God ſhould manifeſt the favour of his knowledge in every place; So that which Chriſt ſpake, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15. he ſpake it to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, who albeit they were more excellent perſons then the reſt of the people, yet he telleth them, <hi>Sine me nihil poteſtis facere.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The negative being generall, we may make a very good uſe of it, If the Apoſtles of Chriſt were unable, how much more are we: If <hi>Jacob</hi> ſay, <hi>I am unworthy of the leaſt of thy bleſsings, Gen.</hi> 32. If <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſay, <hi>I am not worthy, Mat.</hi> 3. If S. <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſe, <hi>I am not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be called an Apoſtle,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. much more may we ſay with the Prodigall ſonne, that had ſpent all, <hi>I am not worthy to be called thy ſonne, Luk.</hi> 15. and with the Centurion, <hi>I am not worthy thou ſhouldeſt come under my roofe, Mat.</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon of this <hi>want of ability</hi> is, for that the nature of men cannot performe that which the Apoſtle ſpeakes of, neither as it is in an eſtate decayed through the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and that generall corruption, that he hath brought into the whole race of mankind; nor as it is reſtored to the higheſt degree of perfection, that the firſt man had, at the beginning. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelfe, when he was yet perfect, could not attaine to this, for he was but a <hi>living ſoule;</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> was a <hi>quickning ſpirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And it is not in the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of nature to elevate, and lift it ſelfe up, to conceive hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partakers of the bleſſedneſſe of the life to come, to hope to be made <hi>partakers of the Divine Nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. and of the heavenly ſubſtance: if men hope for any ſuch thing, it is the ſpirit of God that raiſeth them up to it.</p>
                           <p>As the water can riſe no higher then nature will give it leave, and as the fire giveth heat onely within a certaine compaſſe, ſo the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,</hi> which <hi>Adam</hi> had, was in certaine compaſſe, the light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that he had, did not reach ſo high as to ſtirre him up to the hope of the bleſſedneſſe to come; that was without the compaſſe of nature, and comes by the ſupernaturall working of grace.</p>
                           <p>As we are corrupt, it never commeth into our minds, to hope for the felicity of the life to come; <hi>for all the thoughts of mans heart are onely evill, and that all the day long, Gen.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>That is true, which the Apoſtle witneſſeth of the Gentiles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.13. <hi>That they by nature do the things of the Law;</hi> if we underſtand it of morall duties (for the very light of nature doth guide us to the doing of them.) But as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.2. <hi>My goodneſſe doth not extend to thee.</hi> So whatſoever good thing we doe, by the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of naturall reaſon, it is without all reſpect of God, except he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten us before. Therefore in our regeneration, not onely the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our will is healed, but a certaine divine ſparke of fire, and zeale of Gods Spirit is infuſed into us, by which we are holpen to do thoſe duties of piety, which otherwiſe naturally we have no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to do.</p>
                           <p>Now followes the qualification of this generall negative ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. For where the Apoſtle hath ſaid, <hi>We are not able to thinke any thing of our ſelves;</hi> the Scripture recordeth divers good purpoſes, that came into the hearts of Gods ſervants. The Lord himſelfe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48000:295"/>ſaid of <hi>David: Whereas it was in thine heart to build an houſe to my name, thou diddeſt well in thinking ſo to doe,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.18. The Apoſtle ſaith of unmarried folkes, <hi>that they care for the things that belong to the Lord, how they may pleaſe the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.32. But the Apoſtle ſheweth, that if we have any ſuch thoughts at any time, they do not proceed from us.</p>
                           <p>By which words the Apoſtle, no doubt, maketh this diſtinction, that there are ſome things that come of <hi>us,</hi> and are <hi>of our ſelves:</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, there are other things that come <hi>from us,</hi> and yet are not of <hi>us,</hi> that is from, and of our ſelves, that groweth in us naturally.</p>
                           <p>That is ſaid to be <hi>from our ſelves,</hi> but not <hi>of our ſelves,</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted in us: It is the true Olive, that <hi>from it ſelfe,</hi> and <hi>of it ſelfe</hi> yeeldeth fatneſſe; and the wild Olive being ingrafted in it, doth <hi>from it ſelf</hi> yeeld fatneſſe, but not <hi>of it ſelf,</hi> but as it is by inſition made partaker of that fatnes, which naturally is in the true Olive, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Figmenta cogitationis,</hi> are from, and of our ſelves; but if any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, and ſpirituall thoughts come into our hearts, the <hi>Lord God is the Potter that frames them in us, Jer.</hi> 18.6.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Scio quod in me, hoc eſt, in carne mea, non habitat bonum, Rom.</hi> 7.18. But <hi>ſinne dwels in mee, v.</hi> 17. therefore ſinne, that dwels in us, is <hi>from us,</hi> and <hi>of us;</hi> but the grace of Gods ſpirit, which dwells not in us, but doth tarry gueſt-wiſe, is that, which is <hi>from us,</hi> but not <hi>of us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.38. <hi>Why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts?</hi> ſuch thoughts are <hi>from us,</hi> and <hi>of us;</hi> but thoſe thoughts, that come from the <hi>Father of light, James</hi> 1. are <hi>from our ſelves,</hi> but not <hi>of us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>All that we have by the ſtrength of nature, is ſaid to be <hi>of our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>from our ſelves,</hi> but the power, wherewith we are endued from above, to the doing of heavenly, and ſpirituall things, <hi>of our ſelves,</hi> but not <hi>from our ſelves: Perditio tua ex te Iſrael, Hoſ.</hi> 13. that is <hi>from us,</hi> and <hi>of us; Tantummodo ſalus ex me;</hi> that is neither <hi>of us,</hi> nor <hi>from us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. <hi>I perſecuted the Church:</hi> that was <hi>from himſelfe,</hi> and <hi>of himſelfe;</hi> but when he ſaith, <hi>yet I laboured more then they all,</hi> he corrected that, and ſaith, <hi>yet not I, but the grace of God with mee:</hi> Becauſe that was <hi>of himſelfe,</hi> but not <hi>from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,</hi> but from the grace of God, which did co-operate with him.</p>
                           <p>Sinnes are <hi>of our ſelves,</hi> and <hi>from our ſelves,</hi> but not good actions. <hi>Hoc piarum mentium eſt, ut nihil ſibi tribuant,</hi> this is the part of godly ſoules, that they attribute nothing to themſelves. <hi>Aug.</hi> It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to aſcribe too little to the grace of God, for then we robbe him of his Glory; but if we aſcribe too little to our ſelves, there is no danger: for whatſoever we take from our ſelves, it cannot hinder us from being true Chriſtians: but if we aſcribe that to the ſtrength of our owne nature, which is the proper worke of Grace, then do we blemiſh Gods Glory.</p>
                           <p>The affirmative part is, <hi>our ſufficiencie is of God.</hi> So that albeit, in regard of themſelves he ſaid, <hi>Who is ſufficient to theſe things?</hi> yet, having ability from God, he is bold to ſay, <hi>Omnia poſſum in eo qui me confortat, Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>

And ſo much we are to underſtand, by the words of the Evangeliſt, when he ſaith, <hi>That from the fulneſſe of Chriſt we received grace for grace, Joh.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>As <hi>Noah</hi> is reported to have <hi>found grace in the ſight of God, Gen.</hi> 6. So many do find grace with God: firſt, he worketh grace in men, by the meanes of his Word, when before they were void of grace, <hi>The grace of God hath appeared to all, teaching them, Tit.</hi> 2.12. Alſo by the meanes of the Croſſe, <hi>Job.</hi> 33. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. and by that he wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a ſecond grace that is <hi>inherent,</hi> whereby they are enabled to do the duties of holineſſe.</p>
                           <p>In which reſpect, as he is ſaid to give grace, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. <hi>Humilibus dat gratiam:</hi> ſo we receive grace, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. After God by his ſpirit hath thus enabled us, we are ſaid to be able, and meete, to do thoſe things which we are commanded; ſo that, though our righteouſneſſe be but <hi>menſtrualis juſtitia, Iſay</hi> 64. he will not reject it: though our zeale in godlineſſe be but as <hi>ſmoking flaxe,</hi> or the <hi>broken reed,</hi> he will not <hi>quench,</hi> nor <hi>breake</hi> it, <hi>Iſay</hi> 42. and though the meaſure of our charity exceed not the cup of cold water, yet we ſhall not <hi>loſe our reward, Matth.</hi> 10.

                                 </gap>t is God onely, from whom every good giving, and every perfect gift commeth:</hi> And that we ſhall erre, if we either thinke, that any good thing, which we enjoy, commeth from any other but from God, or that any thing elſe but good proceedeth from him; ſo that as well the ability which man had by nature, as our enabling in the ſtate of grace, is from God. <hi>He is the Fountaine, out of whom</hi> (as the Wiſeman ſaith) <hi>we muſt draw grace by prayer,</hi> which is, <hi>Situla gratiae,</hi> the conduit or bucket of grace. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he promiſeth, in the old Teſtament, <hi>To poure upon his Church, both the Spirit of grace and of prayer,</hi> that as they ſue for grace, by the one, ſo they may receive it in, by the other, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Unto this doctrine of the Apoſtle, in this place, even thoſe, that otherwiſe have no care of grace, doe ſubſcribe, when they confeſſe themſelves to be deſtitute of the good things of this life, and therefore cry, <hi>Quis oftendit nobis bona? Pſal.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>As before the Apoſtle ſhewed that God is not the cauſe of any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill; ſo in this verſe he teacheth, there is no good thing, but God is the author of it; If he be the Fountaine of every good thing, then he cannot be the cauſe of evill; for <hi>no one Fountaine doth out of the ſame hole, yeeld ſweet and bitter water. Iam.</hi> 3.11.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if every good thing be of God <hi>onely,</hi> then have we neede to ſue to him by prayer, that from him we may receive that, which we have not <hi>of our ſelves.</hi> Wherefore as this Scripture ſerves to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in us the love of God, for as much as he containes all good things that we can deſire; ſo it is a ſpeciall meanes to provoke us to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of prayer.</p>

                           <p>This propoſition hath two parts: firſt, an <hi>Vniverſall affirmative</hi> in theſe words, <hi>Every good giving:</hi> ſecondly, a <hi>prevention;</hi> for where it may be objected, that howſoever ſome good things come of God, yet evill things alſo may ſucceſſively come from him; even as the Heathens ſay, that <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath divers boxes, out of which hee doth powre both good and evill: the Apoſtle preventeth that objection, and ſaith, <hi>that with God there is no variableneſſe, nor ſhadow of chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging:</hi> So that as the meaning of theſe words in the Prophet <hi>Hoſea</hi> 13.9. <hi>Salus tua taniummodo ex me,</hi> is both, that ſalvation is <hi>onely</hi> of God, and that <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but ſalvation commeth from him; ſo the Apoſtles meaning in theſe words is, both, that God is onely the cauſe of good, and that he is the cauſe of <hi>nothing elſe</hi> but good, leſt when we are tempted unto evill, we ſhould make God the Author of all ſuch temptations.</p>
                           <p>The former part of the propoſition called <hi>ſubjectum,</hi> is, <hi>Every good giving, &amp;c.</hi> The latter part, called <hi>praedicatum,</hi> is, <hi>deſcendeth from above.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Where the heathen call all vertues and good qualities which they have, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, of <hi>giving,</hi> to teach us that whatſoever good quality is in any man, he hath it not as a quality within himſelfe, but he receiveth it from without, as it is a gift.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſpeaking of the bleſſings beſtowed upon him, ſaith, <hi>I have enough, Gen.</hi> 3.3.

Againe, when <hi>Pilate</hi> without all reſpect of God, of whom the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There is no power but of God, Rom.</hi> 13. ſaid, <hi>Knoweſt thou not, that I have power to crucifie, and to looſe thee?</hi> our Saviour ſaid againe, <hi>Thou ſhouldeſt not have any power over me, except it were given thee from above. Iohn</hi> 19.10.</p>
                           <p>The conſideration hereof ſerveth to exclude our <hi>boaſting, Rom.</hi> 3. That <hi>the Wiſe man boaſt not of his wiſdome, Ier.</hi> 9. ſeeing wiſdome, ſtrength, and whatſoever good things we have, it is the good gift of God, as the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>Quid habes, quod non accepiſti?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, this diviſion is to be marked, that of the good things which come from God, ſome are called <hi>Donationes,</hi> others <hi>Dona:</hi> and to theſe two ſubſtantives, are added two adjectives, whereof one doth anſwer to the <hi>givings</hi> of Gods goodneſſe, the other to the <hi>gifts</hi> of God aſcribeth <hi>perfection.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The firſt errour the Apoſtle willeth them to beware, is, that they thinke not that God is the cauſe of <hi>any evill,</hi> becauſe every good thing commeth from him: the ſecond errour is, that they ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this opinion, that the <hi>maine benefits</hi> are from God, and the <hi>leſſer benefits</hi> are from our ſelves; not ſo, for the Apoſtle tels us, that as well, <hi>every good giving,</hi> as <hi>every perfect gift is from above.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That which the Apoſtle cals <hi>Donatio,</hi> is a tranſitory thing: but by <hi>gift,</hi> he meaneth that which is permanent and laſting.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Ioſeph</hi> is recorded to have given to his brethren, not onely <hi>corne, but

So by <hi>giving,</hi> the Apoſtle here underſtandeth ſuch things as we neede in this life, while wee tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell towards our heavenly Countrey, but that which he calleth <hi>gifts,</hi> are the treaſures which are laid up for us in the life to come; and thus the words are uſed in theſe ſeverall ſenſes.</p>
                           <p>Of things tranſitory the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>No Church dealt with me in the matter of giving, Phil.</hi> 4.15. there the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, but ſpeaking of the good things that come to us by Chriſt, he ſaith: <hi>The gift is not as the fault, Rom.</hi> 5.16. where the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>
                           </p>
                           <p>By <hi>Givings</hi> he underſtandeth, beauty, ſtrength, riches, and every tranſitory thing whereof we ſtand in neede, while we are yet in our journey towards our heavenly countrey; ſuch as <hi>Iob</hi> ſpeakes of, <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus dedit, Dominus abstulit, Iob</hi> 1.21. By <hi>gift</hi> he meaneth the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity that is reſerved for us after this life, the Kingdome of Heaven, that whereof our Saviour ſaith to <hi>Martha, Luke</hi> 10. <hi>Mary hath choſen the better part, which ſhall not be taken from her.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That which is a ſtay to us in this life, <hi>is</hi>

                              </gap>, but <hi>the things which neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare heard, all which are reſerved for them that love God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. theſe are <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, and as well the one, as the other, come from God. So much we are taught by the adjectives that are joyned to theſe words. <hi>Givings</hi> are called <hi>good,</hi> and the <hi>Gifts</hi> of God are called <hi>perfect:</hi> In which words the Apoſtles purpoſe is to teach us, that not onely the great benefits of the life to come, ſuch as are perfect, are of him; but that even that good which we have in this life, though it be yet imperfect, and may be made better, is received from him, and not elſe where, <hi>Who doth deſpiſe little things?</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.10.</p>
                           <p>God is the Author both of <hi>perfect</hi> and <hi>good things:</hi> as the Image of the Prince is to be ſeene as well in a ſmall peece of coine, as in a peece of greater value; ſo we are to conſider the goodnes of God as well in the things of this life, as in the graces that concerne the life to come, yea even in this, <hi>To thinke that which is good,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Of him are the ſmall things, as well as the great. Therefore out Saviour teacheth us to pray, not onely for that <hi>perfect gift, ut adveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a: Regnum,</hi> but even for theſe <hi>leſſer good things,</hi> which are but his <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings,</hi> namely, that he would <hi>give us our daily bread.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Under Good, is contained all <hi>gifis,</hi> both naturall, or temporall. Thoſe <hi>givings</hi> which are naturall, as to live, to move, and have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, are good, for of them it is ſaid, <hi>God ſaw all that he made, and lo, all was good. Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>Of gifts temporall, the Heathen have doubted, whether they were good, to wit, riches, honour, &amp;c. but the Chriſtians are reſolved that they are good, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. So our Saviour teacheth us to eſteeme them, when ſpeaking of fiſh, and bread, he ſaith, <hi>If you which are evill, can give your children good things, Luke</hi> 11. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Hee that hath this worlds good,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. For as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, That is not onely good, <hi>quod facit bonum, ſed de quo fit bonum,</hi> that is not onely good that makes good, but whereof is made good. ſo albeit riches do not make a man good alwaies; yet becauſe he may do good with them, they are good.</p>
                           <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48000:298"/>
                           <p>The <hi>gift</hi> which the Apoſtle cals <hi>perfect,</hi> is <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> whereof there is in this life the beginning of perfection; the other in the life to come, is the end and conſtancie of our perfection, whereof the Prophet ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.12. <hi>The Lord will give grace and glory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Nihil perfectum adduxit Lex, The Law brought nothing to perfection. Heb.</hi> 7. that is by reaſon of the imperfection of our nature, and <hi>the weakneſſe of our fleſh. Rom.</hi> 8.3.</p>
                           <p>To ſupply the defect that is in nature, grace is added, that grace might make that perfect which is imperfect.</p>
                           <p>The perſon that giveth us this grace is Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>by whom grace and truth came. Iohn.</hi> 1. And therefore he ſaith, <hi>Eſtote perfecti ſicut Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter veſter coeleſtis perfectus eſt. Matth.</hi> 5. And by this grace not only our ſinnes are taken away, but our ſoules are endued with <hi>inherent</hi> vertues, and receive grace and ability from God, to proceed from one degree of perfection to another, all our life time, even till the time of our death, which is the <hi>beginning</hi> and <hi>accompliſhment</hi> of our perfection, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſpeakes of his death. <hi>Luke</hi> 13.32.</p>
                           <p>In the latter part of the propoſition we are to conſider the <hi>place, from whence,</hi> and the perſon, <hi>from whom</hi> we receive theſe gifts; the one is <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernè,</hi> the other, <hi>à Patre luminum:</hi> Now he inſtructeth us to beware of a third errour, that we looke not either on the right hand, or on the left hand, that we regard not the perſons of great men, which are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments of God, if we have any good from them, all the good we have it is <hi>de ſurſum,</hi> the thoughts of our hearts that ariſe in them, if they tend to good, are not of our ſelves, but infuſed into us by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power of Gods ſpirit, and ſo is whatſoever good thought, word, or worke, proceeding from us. This is one of the firſt parts of divinity, <hi>Iobn Baptiſt</hi> taught; <hi>A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from above, Iohn</hi> 3.27. This was the cauſe of Chriſt aſcending into Heaven, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. <hi>He went up on high,</hi> and <hi>dedit dona hominibus:</hi> and the Evangeliſt faith, <hi>the holy Ghoſt</hi> (which is the moſt perfect gift that can come to men) <hi>was not yet given, becauſe Chriſt was not yet aſcended. Iohn</hi> 7.39. Therefore if we poſſeſſe any bleſſing, or receive any benefit, we muſt not looke to earthly meanes, but to Heaven.</p>
                           <p>The thing which is here mentioned excludeth the fourth errour: we thinke that things come to us by fortune, or cuſtomably: he ſaies not, that good things fall downe from above, but they deſcend, <hi>&amp; qui de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendit, propoſito deſcendit.</hi> Our inſtruction from hence is, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from a cauſe <hi>intelligent,</hi> even from God himſelfe, who in his counſell and proviſion beſtoweth his bleſſings as ſeemeth beſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe: for as the Heathen man ſpeakes, God hath, <hi>ſinum facilem,</hi> but not <hi>perforatum,</hi> that is, a lappe, eaſie to receive and yeeld, but not bored through, to let things fall through without diſcretion.</p>
                           <p>When the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Tu aper is manum, Pſal.</hi> 145.15. he doth not ſay that God lets his bleſſings droppe out of his fingers. Chriſt when he promiſed to his Diſciples to ſend the Comforter, ſaith, <hi>Ego mittameum advos. Iohn</hi> 16.7. Whereby he giveth them to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that it is not by caſualty, or chance, that the holy Ghoſt ſhall come upon them, but by the deliberate counſell of God; ſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48000:298"/>poſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Of his owne will begat he us, by the word of truth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The perſon from whom, is the Father of lights. The Heathens found this to be true, that all good things come from above, but they thought that the lights in Heaven are the cauſes of all good things, therefore is it that they worſhip the Sunne, Moone, and Starres. <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>Be not deceived, all good things come not from the lights, but from the Father of lights.</hi> The naturall lights were made <hi>in ministerium cunctis gentibus, Deut.</hi> 4. and the Angels, that are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall lights, are appointed to do ſervice unto the Elect. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.13.</p>
                           <p>It is the Father of lights, that giveth us all good things; therefore he <hi>onely</hi> is to be worſhipped, and not the lights, which he hath made to our uſe.</p>
                           <p>God is called the Father of <hi>lights,</hi> Firſt, in oppoſition to the lights themſelves, to teach us, that the lights are not the cauſes of good things, but he that ſaid, <hi>fiat lux, Gen.</hi> 1. Secondly, in regard of the <hi>emanation,</hi> whether we reſpect the Sunne-beames called <hi>radii,</hi> ſhining in at a little hole, or the great beame of the Sun, called <hi>Iubar,</hi> he is au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of both, and ſo is the cauſe of all the light of underſtanding, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be in ſmall, or great meaſure: Thirdly, to ſhew the nature of God: nothing hath ſo great alliance with God, as <hi>light: The light ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth all things manifeſt, Epheſ.</hi> 5. and <hi>the wicked hate the light, becauſe their workes are evill, Iohn</hi> 3. But God is the Father of lights, becauſe as out of light commeth nothing but light, ſo <hi>God is the cauſe of that which is good. Prov.</hi> 13.</p>
                           <p>Againe, light is the cauſe of goodneſſe, to thoſe things that are good of themſelves; <hi>It is a pleaſant thing to behold the light. Eccleſ.</hi> 11. On the other ſide; howſoever good things are in themſelves, yet they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſmall pleaſure, or delight, to him that is ſhut up in a dark dungeon, where he is deprived of the benefit of light. So God is the Father of lights, for that not onely all things have their goodneſſe from him, but becauſe he makes them good alſo.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Light</hi> is the firſt good thing that God created for man, <hi>fiat lux, Gen.</hi> 1. But God is the Father of lights, to ſhew that he is the firſt cauſe of any good thing, that can come to us.</p>
                           <p>Againe, becauſe he is that onely cauſe of the viſible light, which at the firſt he created, and alſo of that ſpirituall light, whereby he ſhineth into our hearts, by the light of the Goſpel, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. the Apoſtle ſaith of the whole Trinity, <hi>Deus lux eſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.5. More particularly Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>Ego ſum lux mundi, Iohn</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>The holy Ghoſt is called <hi>light,</hi> where he is repreſented by the <hi>fiery tongues, Act.</hi> 2.3. The Angels are <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. <hi>David</hi> alſo, as a civill Magiſtrate, was called <hi>the light of Iſrael.</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.17. Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticall Miniſters are called <hi>light, Vos eſtis lux mundi. Matth.</hi> 5. And not onely they, but the people that are of good converſation, are ſaid to ſhine, <hi>tanquam luminaria in mundo. Phil.</hi> 2. All theſe <hi>lights</hi> have their being from God, and for this cauſe he is worthily called <hi>lux mundi,</hi> and <hi>the Father of lights.</hi> A againe, this name is oppoſed unto dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>God is light, and in him there is no darkneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.5. Therefore the ignorance of our minds is not to be imputed unto him. <hi>He is the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48000:299"/>light that lightneth every one, Iohn</hi> 1.9. and <hi>cannot be comprehended of darkneſſe:</hi> Therefore it is not long of him, that we, through ignorance, are ſaid to <hi>ſit in darkneſſe,</hi> and <hi>in the ſhadow of death,</hi> this comes of the Devill, <hi>the Prince of darkneſſe, who blindeth mens eyes.</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. God is the Father of lights.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, he is ſo called to diſtinguiſh him from heat.</p>
                           <p>The lights which we make for theſe private uſes, doe not onely give light, but heat alſo; but God giveth light without heat: wherefore ſuch as are of a fiery ſpirit, as the Diſciples that ſaid, <hi>Shall we command that fire come downe from Heaven, and conſume them?</hi> are not like God. Chriſt is called the <hi>day-ſtarre,</hi> not the dog-ſtarre, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. God is ſaid to have <hi>walked in the coole of the day,</hi> not in the heat of the day, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. When God would ſpeake to <hi>Eliah,</hi> he ſhewed himſelfe neither in the <hi>strong wind, nor in earth-quake, nor in fire, but in a ſmall still voyce.</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 19.12. To teach men, that, if they will be like God, they muſt be of a meeke and quiet ſpirit. He is ſaid to dwell in the light, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. not that he is of a hot fiery nature, as our lights are, but becauſe he giveth us the light of knowledge.</p>
                           <p>In reſpect of the number, he is not called the Father of one light, but <hi>Pater luminum.</hi> It was an imperfection in <hi>Iacob,</hi> that he had but one bleſſing, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. God is not the cauſe of ſome one good thing, but as there are divers ſtarres, <hi>and one starre differeth from another in glory,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. ſo as we receive many good things, and of them ſome are greater then others, ſo they all come from God, who is the Author and fountaine of them all.</p>
                           <p>Our manifold imperfections are noted by the word <hi>tenebrae,</hi> which is a word of the plurall number, and in regard thereof it is needfull, that God, in whom we have perfection, ſhall not be <hi>Pater luminis,</hi> but <hi>Pater luminum.</hi> Our miſeries are many, therefore that he may deliver us quite out of miſeries, there is with the Lord <hi>Copioſa redemptio, Pſal.</hi> 130. The ſinnes which we commit againſt God are many; therefore he is the Father, not of one mercie, but <hi>Pater miſericordiarum,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> tels us, that the mercie of God is <hi>multiformis gratia,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. So that whether we commit ſmall ſinnes or great, we may be bold to call upon God for mercie, <hi>According to the multitude of thy mercies, have mercie upon me, Pſal.</hi> 51. For as our ſinnes doe abound, ſo the mercie of God, whereby he pardoneth and is inclined to pardon us, is <hi>exuberans gratia, Rom.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>darknes</hi> that we are ſubject to, is manifold: there is darkneſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, not only in the underſtanding, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. where the Gentiles are ſaid <hi>to have their cogitations darkned,</hi> but in the heart, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>He that hateth his brother is in darkneſſe.</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>There is the darkneſſe of tribulation and affliction, whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Thou ſhall make my darkneſſe to be light, Pſal.</hi> 18. and the miſery which the wicked ſuffer in the world to come which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour calleth <hi>utter darkneſſe, Matth.</hi> 22. God doth helpe us, and give us light in all theſe darkneſſes, and therefore is called the Father of lights.</p>
                           <p>As the Sunne giveth light to the body, ſo God hath provided light
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48000:299"/>for the ſoule, and that is firſt the <hi>light of nature,</hi> which teacheth us, that this is a juſt thing, <hi>ne alii facias quod tibi fieri non vis,</hi> from this light we have this knowledge, that we are not of our ſelves, but of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and of this light the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>The ſoule of man is the candle of the Lord. Prov.</hi> 20.27. They that reſiſt this light of nature are called, <hi>rebelles Lumini. Iob</hi> 24. With this light <hi>every one that commeth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this world is inlightned. Iohn</hi> 1.9. Howbeit this light hath caught a fall, as <hi>Mephiboſheth</hi> did, and thereupon it halteth, notwithſtanding, becauſe it is of the bloud royall, it is worthy to be made of.</p>
                           <p>Next, God kindleth a light of grace by his word, which is, <hi>lux pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibus; Pſal.</hi> 119. and <hi>lux oculis, Pſal.</hi> 19. and that we may be capable of this outward light, he lightneth us with his ſpirit, becauſe the light of the law ſhined but darkly; therefore he hath called us into the light of his Goſpell, which is his <hi>marvellous light,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>He lighteth the outward darkneſſe of affliction, by miniſtring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, <hi>There ſpringeth up light for the righteous, and joyfull gladneſſe for ſuch as are true of heart. Pſal.</hi> 97.11. <hi>In the multitude of my ſorrowes, thy comforts have refreſhed my ſoule. Pſal.</hi> 94. He giveth us <hi>everlaſting conſolation,</hi> and <hi>good hope through grace.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2. And that we ſhould not be caſt into utter darkneſſe, he hath made us, <hi>meete to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, yea he hath delivered us from the power of darkneſſe, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdome of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Sonne. Col.</hi> 1.12.</p>
                           <p>Of theſe things it followeth: firſt, if all good things be <hi>gifts,</hi> wee may not boaſt of them; if they come from God, we may not forget him, from whom we receive them.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, becauſe <hi>Gifts</hi> are rather <hi>Commendata, quam data,</hi> becauſe there is <gap reason="foreign">

                              <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Fter the conſideration of our owne unability, mentioned by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. And the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the manifold goodneſſe of God, from whom, as Saint <hi>Iames</hi> ſaith, <hi>every good giving, and every perfect gift commeth:</hi> Becauſe wee ſee that of our ſelves we cannot ſo much as think any good, and yet that from the <hi>Father of lights</hi> wee may receive that grace which ſhall inable us to doe all things; Now it followeth by good order, that we repaire to God for that power, which we have not of our ſelves. Chriſt will not have <hi>holy things given to dogges,</hi> nor <hi>pearles caſt to ſwine,</hi> that is, to ſuch as make no account of them; and therefore if we eſteeme of the grace of Chriſt, or make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reckoning of it, we muſt come to him for it; now we cannot come to God, but by prayer, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non paſsibus, ſed precibus, itur ad Deum: &amp; nuncius noſter oratio eſt, quae ibi mandatum noſtrum peragit, quo caro noſtra pervenire nequit:</hi> It is not with paſes, but with prayers we goe to God; and our meſſenger is prayer, which there doth our errand, where our fleſh cannot come. Therefore Chriſt ſaith: <hi>Doe not waite as ſwine, till the grace of God be cast unto you, but if you will have it, aske, and it ſhall be given to you.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The tenor of this Scripture hath this coherence: firſt, knowing our owne inſufficiencie, and the goodneſſe of God, from whom every <hi>good thing</hi> commeth, preſently we wiſh with our ſelves that he would admit us to be ſuiters unto him. Therefore Chriſt in the word <hi>Aske,</hi> tels us, that God hath his Courts of requeſts, that we may be bold to put up our ſupplications.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, whereas earthly Princes may perhaps afford a good countenance, but will not grant the thing that is ſought for at their hands; Chriſt ſaith, that <hi>the Father of lights,</hi> is not onely affable, but liberall; ſo that albeit we be not onely <hi>duſt and aſhes, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unworthy to pray to God, Gen.</hi> 18. but alſo wretched ſinners, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be heard, becauſe as the Blind man ſaith, <hi>peccatores non ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>audit
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48000:300"/>Deus, Iohn</hi> 9. Yet <hi>he will not caſt out our prayers, nor turne his mercie from us, eſal.</hi> 66.18. But if <hi>we aske, it ſhall be given.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that we ſhould not think, that as in the world there are many ſuiters, but few obtainers; ſo howſoever all doe pray unto God, yet we are not in the number of thoſe that ſpeede; therefore Chriſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, <hi>Whoſoever asketh, receiveth: whoſoever ſeeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened:</hi> No unworthineſſe of our owne can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude us from the mercie of God, for he receiveth the prayer, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the <hi>Publican, Luke</hi> 18. but of the <hi>prodigall ſonne, Luke</hi> 15. and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth mercie to the <hi>Thiefe hanging on the Croſſe, Luke</hi> 23. if at the laſt houre he ſeeke it by prayer.</p>
                           <p>Of theſe two verſes there are three parts, firſt a <hi>precept, petite, quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, pulſate:</hi> aske, ſeeke, knock: ſecondly, a <hi>promiſe,</hi> it ſhall be given, ye ſhall finde, and it ſhall be opened: thirdly, an <hi>enlargement</hi> of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which is made not onely to ſuch as are of juſt and holy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, but to ſinners; <hi>For whoſoever asketh, receiveth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As on Gods behalfe we ſee firſt his affability: ſecondly, his libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: thirdly, the largeneſſe of his liberality: ſo on our owne parts we are taught, firſt, that we may boldly powre out our deſires before God: ſecondly, we may conceive hope to be heard in the thing we crave: thirdly, not an uncertaine hope, confounded through our owne unworthineſſe; <hi>For whoſoever asketh, receiveth:</hi> and as Chriſt ſpeaketh, <hi>Him that commeth to me, I will in no wiſe, caſt out. Iohn</hi> 6.37.</p>
                           <p>In the precept foure things are to be conſidered: firſt, the <hi>neceſsity:</hi> ſecondly, the <hi>vehemencie,</hi> ſignified by a three-fold petition, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth an inſtancie, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeakes: <hi>Have I not written three times to thee? Prov.</hi> 22.20. thirdly, the <hi>coherence</hi> of theſe three termes, asking, ſeeking, and knocking: fourthly, the <hi>diſtinguiſhing of them.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Touching the firſt, the example of our Saviour might be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motive to ſtirre us up to prayer, who <hi>in the morning very early before day went into a ſolitary place, and there prayed, Marke</hi> 1.35. and in the evening, prayed himſelfe <hi>alone in the Mountaine, Matth.</hi> 14.23.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, whereas he ſetteth downe a <hi>forme</hi> of prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. He ſheweth that prayer is <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but when unto both he addeth a precept, we may not thinke any longer it is a matter <hi>ind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>fferent,</hi> but of <hi>neceſsity,</hi> a commandement is a thing obligatory. So when Chriſt commands us to pray, he doth not leave it as a thing in our owne choyce; but bindes us to the performance of it, for prayer is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required as a thing ſupplying our neede, (for when wee feele want, we neede not be provoked to prayer;) the bruit beaſts themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pinched with hunger, doe <hi>ſeeke their meate at God, Pſal.</hi> 107. and <hi>the Ravens call upon him for foode, Pſal.</hi> 147. but it is required as a part of Gods ſervice. <hi>Anna</hi> being in the Temple, <hi>ſerved God by prayer, Luke</hi> 2.37. By prayer the Apoſtles performed that ſervice to the Lord, which the Apoſtle cals <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.1. Therefore ſo oft as we reſort to the houſe of God, to put up our petitions to God, then we doe him ſervice <hi>properly,</hi> and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>t onely when wee are preſent at a Sermon, for then God rather ſerveth us, and attends us, and entreates us by his Miniſters <hi>to be reconciled to him,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <pb n="18" facs="tcp:48000:301"/>
                           <p>As prayer is a part of Gods worſhip: ſo the neglect of prayer is a ſinne, as one ſaith, <hi>peccatum non orandi.</hi> Therefore the Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other ſinnes wherewith he chargeth the wicked, reckoneth this to be one, that <hi>they call not on the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 14.9. The neglect of this duty was the beginning of <hi>Sauls</hi> fall, as all the Fathers interpret that place, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.19. where it is ſaid, that <hi>Saul commanded the Prieſt to with-draw his hand from the Arke.</hi> For this hath beene comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ever from the beginning, that we ſhould pray unto God; not onely in the <hi>law of nature, Iob.</hi> 8.5. But alſo in the <hi>law of Moſes, Deut.</hi> 10.12.</p>
                           <p>In the time of the law a ſpeciall part of the ſervice, which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple performed to God, was the offering up of incenſe, and therefore the Prophet <hi>compareth prayer to incenſe, Pſal.</hi> 141.2. And it is moſt fitly reſembled to incenſe, for the uſe of incenſe was to ſweeten thoſe places which are unſavory: Even ſo the wicked imaginations, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſt thoughts of our hearts, which yeeld a ſtinking ſmell in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils of God, are ſweetned by no other meanes then by prayer: and therefore to ſhew how the one is reſembled by the other, it is ſaid, that <hi>while the incenſe was a burning, the people were without upon their knees in prayer, Luke</hi> 1.10. neither was it a thing uſuall in the law onely, but alſo in the Prophets. <hi>Call upon me, Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>&amp; aperi os tuum &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plebo, Pſal.</hi> 81.</p>
                           <p>Touching the effect and fruit whereof it is ſaid, <hi>Whoſoever calleth on the name of the Lord, ſhall be ſaved, Ioel</hi> 2. Secondly, albeit God have little Commandements, as Chriſt ſpeakes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5. <hi>Hee that breakes one of theſe little Commandements:</hi> Yet this, touching the duty of prayer is not a ſlight Commandement, but of great inſtance, and ſo much we are to gather from hence, that Chriſt is not content once to ſay, <hi>Aske,</hi> but repeates it in three ſeverall termes: <hi>aske, ſeeke, knock;</hi> which as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, ſheweth <hi>inſtantiſsimam neceſsitatem.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>From the vehemencie of this Commandement we are to conſider theſe three things: firſt, it lets us ſee our <hi>want and neede,</hi> in that wee are willed to <hi>aske:</hi> ſecondly, by <hi>ſeeking,</hi> Chriſt doth intimate thus much to us; that we have <hi>loſt</hi> our ſelves: thirdly, in that he would have us to <hi>knocke,</hi> he would have us to learne that we are as men <hi>ſhut out of the preſence of God, and his Kingdome, where is the fulneſſe of joy, and pleaſure for ever.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The firſt ſheweth man what is the miſery of his eſtate, in regard whereof he is called <hi>Enoch:</hi> ſecondly, his blindneſſe, which is ſo great, that when he doth pray, he asketh <hi>he knowes not what, Matth.</hi> 20. If hee would pray, he knowes not how to pray, for which cauſe the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples deſire Chriſt <hi>to teach them, Luke</hi> 11. Their blindneſſe is ſuch as they know not the way to come to the Father, as <hi>Thomas</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.5. Thirdly, it ſheweth our ſlothfulneſſe in ſeeking our owne good, which appeareth herein, that we have neede to have a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement given us to ſtirre us up to pray to God.</p>
                           <p>The third thing in the precept is the <hi>dependance</hi> of theſe three word, <hi>petite, quaerite, pulſate.</hi> For there is no idle word in Gods book. Therefore as they that have to doe with Gold, will make no waſte at
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48000:301"/>all, but gather together the leaſt paring: ſo we muſt eſteeme preciouſly of Gods word, which is more precious then Gold. We muſt be gone hence, and there is a place whither we deſire all to come, which wee cannot doe, except we knocke: and becauſe we know not at what dore to knocke, therefore we muſt ſeeke the dore; But we have no will nor deſire to ſeeke, therefore Chriſt willeth in the firſt place that we <hi>aske it,</hi> and the thing that we muſt aske, is the ſpirit of grace, and of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: and if we aske it, then ſhall we have ability and power, not only to ſeeke the dore, but when we have found it, to knock at it.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, as theſe words depend one upon another, ſo they are to be <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> one from another: they that are ſuitors for any earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly benefit, doe occupie, not onely their tongue in ſpeaking, but their legges in reſorting to great perſons: they that ſeeke, doe occupie not onely their legges, in going up and downe, but their eyes to looke in every place; and they that knock, as they uſe other members, ſo eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they uſe their hands: But when our Saviour enjoyneth us the uſe of prayer, he expreſſeth it not in one word, but in three ſeverall termes; to teach us, that when we come to pray to God, the whole man muſt be occupied, and all the members of the body imployed in the ſervice of God; for Chriſt will not have pearls caſt unto ſwine; and we may not looke to have the gifts of God <hi>caſt into our mouthes:</hi> but if we will obtaine, we muſt firſt, <hi>open our mouthes to aske it, Pſal.</hi> 81. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are not ſo eaſily found, as that we ſhall ſtumble upon them: but we muſt ſeeke diligently, <hi>with the lifting up of our eyes. Pſal.</hi> 1.20. <hi>And to God that dwels in the Heavens. Pſal.</hi> 123. Thirdly, becauſe the dore is ſhut and locked up, therefore we muſt knock, for which end we are willed, <hi>To lift up our hands with our hearts to God which is in Heaven, Lam.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>The lifting up of our hand is that which the people call the <hi>Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifice, Pſal.</hi> 141. As the body, ſo alſo the ſoule may not bee idle, but occupied with theſe three vertues: firſt, it muſt <hi>petere,</hi> which noteth <hi>confidence</hi> and <hi>truſt:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>quaerere,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:</hi> thirdly, <hi>pulſare,</hi> which implyeth <hi>perſeverance:</hi> If we joyne theſe three vertues to our prayer, doubtleſſe we ſhall be heard.</p>
                           <p>As the ſecond cauſe of our life here is, <hi>ſudor vultus:</hi> (for we live <hi>arando, ac ſerendo</hi>) by plowing, and ſowing; ſo the ſecond cauſe of our living is another <hi>ſudor vultus;</hi> which conſiſteth in <hi>asking, ſeeking, knocking:</hi> As in the ſweate of our browes we eate the bread that feeds our bodies, ſo by theſe ſpirituall paines, and endeavours we come to the bread of life, which feedeth our ſoules eternally.</p>
                           <p>Now if we aske that queſtion that is made <hi>Iob</hi> 21.15. <hi>What profit ſhall we have if we pray unto him?</hi> It is certaine that God having cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated us, may juſtly command us: but he doth not onely conſtraine us to pray by his commandement, but allure us thereunto by his promiſe: he ſaith, if we aske the life of grace, we ſhall obtaine it; if we ſeeke it, we ſhall finde it; thirdly, having found the way, we ſhall <hi>intrare ingau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium Domini, enter into our Maſters joy, Matth.</hi> 25.</p>
                           <p>If we aske, we ſhall have grace, whereby it ſhall appeare, we have not received <hi>our ſoule in vaine, Pſal.</hi> 24. ſecondly, ſeeking we ſhall finde
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48000:302"/>the helpe and aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit, ſo that we ſhall not receive <hi>grace in vaine,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. thirdly, by knocking, the way of entrance ſhall be opened unto us, ſo that <hi>our labour ſhall not be in vaine in the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. as <hi>Aug.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non dicitur quid dabitur,</hi> Chriſt nameth not what ſhall be given to you: to let us know, that that gift is a thing <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra omne nomen,</hi> above all that can be named.</p>
                           <p>It is as great a gift as an earthly Prince can give, to promiſe <hi>halfe his King dome, Marke</hi> 6.23. but God hath promiſed not halfe his Kingdome, but all his Kingdome; we ſhall receive of God, not onely <hi>whatſoever we deſire,</hi> (For <hi>deſiderare noſtrum,</hi> as one ſaith, is not <hi>terminus bonitatis Dei,</hi> our deſire is not the limit or bounds of Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) <hi>but above all that we can aske or thinke. Epheſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>In the confidence of this promiſe the Saints of God in the time of their miſery fly unto God by prayer, as their onely ready helpe. In the dayes of <hi>Enoch,</hi> which were full of miſeries and troubles, men <hi>began to call upon the name of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 4.26. and <hi>Abraham</hi> in every place where he came, being departed out of his owne Countrey, and living in exile, <hi>built an Altar, and called on the name of the Lord. Gen.</hi> 12.8. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſaith, that his onely remedy which he uſed againſt the ſlander and injuries of his enemies, ſtood herein, that <hi>he gave himſelfe to prayer. Pſal.</hi> 109. <hi>Ioſaphat</hi> being beſieged with enemies on every ſide, uſed this as a bulwarke againſt them: <hi>Lord we have no power to with-stand this great company that are come againſt us, and we know not what to doe, but our eyes are towards thee.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20. The like comfort did <hi>Ezechiah</hi> find in prayer, both when <hi>Senacherib</hi> threatned his deſtruction, and in his ſickneſſe: and it is indeed the City of refuge, whither the godly in all times have uſed to flie for ſafegard from their miſeries. It is <hi>rete gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum, &amp; ſitula gratiae,</hi> the <hi>net of graces, and bucket of grace, Prov.</hi> 12.2. by which a good man draweth the grace of God.</p>
                           <p>The ſpeciall gift that we can deſire of God is Chriſt himſelfe, who is <hi>Donum illud Dei. Iohn</hi> 4. Now foraſmuch as indeed nothing can be a greater benefit, then to enjoy the preſence of God, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Whom doe I deſire in Heaven but thee? Pſal.</hi> 73. and <hi>Philip</hi> ſaith, <hi>Oſtende nobis patrem, &amp; ſufficit, Shew us the Father, and it is ſufficient, Iohn</hi> 14. wee are to conſider how we may come to it.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the way, Iohn</hi> 14. <hi>&amp; ego ſum ostium, Iohn</hi> 10. If he be both the way and the dore, then no doubt but if God beſtow Chriſt on us, we ſhall both finde the way to God, and enter into his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, by Chriſt, who is the dore: for the obtaining of this gift wee muſt be inſtant with God in prayer, which if we doe, he will give us that we aske: therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Domine cupiote, da mihi ſolumie, out non dimittamte, Lord I deſire thee, give me thee alone, or elſe I will not let thee goe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the third place our Saviour enlargeth the promiſe, leſt we ſhould doubt that God will not heare all manner of perſons, that pray to him, or that he will not grant all our ſuites, therefore in regard of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Quiſquis, whoſoever asketh, receiveth,</hi> whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver joyne theſe three vertues in their prayer, <hi>Confidence, Diligence, Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> and occupie all the parts of their body in this ſervice of God,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48000:302"/>they ſhall be ſure to receive the thing they aske, for the promiſe is made onely to them that performe Gods Commandement, <hi>petenti da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur,</hi> we muſt aske, and we ſhall have it: for God uſeth not to <hi>caſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things upon them that make no reckoning of them, Matth.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>Touching the things themſelves, Hee that is the truth hath ſaid, <hi>Whatſoever you aske my Father in my name, he will give it you. Iohn</hi> 16. Therefore it is impoſſible he ſhould lie, eſpecially when he confirmeth it with an oath, as in that place, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever you aske the Father in my name, he will give it you.</hi> But wee muſt take need what we aske: we may not <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, aske without a cauſe. If we aske any thing <hi>according to his will,</hi> he heareth us. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our prayers muſt be grounded upon ſome juſt cauſe: we may not aske any childiſh petition of God, for he will revert them. If we like children aske we know not what, we cannot aſſure our ſelves to bee heard, for unto ſuch prayers he anſwereth, <hi>Yee aske you know not what, Matth.</hi> 20. Much leſſe will he grant hurtfull petitions.</p>
                           <p>As he is our Phyſitian, he will not give us cold drinke when we are ſick of an ague, though we cry for it never ſo much. They that ask <hi>ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance</hi> of God, and would have him to be the executioner of their wrath, <hi>ſhall not be heard, Prov.</hi> 26.13. but <hi>their prayer is turned to ſinne, Pſal.</hi> 109. So farre is it from the ſervice of God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>If the child aske fiſh, the Father will not give him a Scorpion, no more will God heare us in thoſe things which we aske of him, if hee know they will be hurtfull.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He onely is wiſe, and knoweth what is good for us, and if we receive not the thing which we aske, yet he (as <hi>Ierome</hi> ſaith) <hi>non accipiendo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepit,</hi> in not receiving, he hath received. Chriſt ſaith not, aske, and ye ſhall receive the thing ye aske, but <hi>aske and it ſhall be given unto you,</hi> that is the thing that you deſire. We all deſire thoſe things that be good, though outwardly we are not able to diſcerne what is good, but God our heavenly Father, as he knoweth beſt what is good for us, ſo he will give us good things, though we be not able alwayes to aske that which is good for our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we muſt pray in ſuch manner and forme, as he requireth; God doth heare us many times even <hi>quando petimus malum:</hi> in as much as he doth not give us the hurtfull things, which we ignorantly aske. But he will not heare us, <hi>cum petimus malè, Yee aske, and receive not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe yee aske amiſſe. Iam.</hi> 4. Therefore we muſt beware how we ſtand affected at the time of prayer: if we pray coldly, without any great deſire to attaine the thing we aske; we aske like ſwine, that eſteeme not of pearles, but trample them under their feet: If <hi>we draw neare with our lips, but our hearts be farre from God, Eſa.</hi> 29. then it is not like we ſhall be heard: If we pray as <hi>Peter,</hi> and the other Diſciples, who being <hi>heavie. with ſleepe,</hi> asked they knew not what, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.32. we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receive the truth. But if, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes, we <hi>ſeeke the Lord with all our heart, Deut.</hi> 4.29. If we doe with <hi>Paul, orare ſpiritu, &amp; orare mente,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. then we may conceive hope to be heard, for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to aske is given <hi>Cordi, non pulmoni,</hi> to the heart, not to the lungs; <hi>Id quod cor non facit, non fit,</hi> that which the heart doth not, is not done.</p>
                           <pb n="22" facs="tcp:48000:303"/>
                           <p>Secondly, touching the manner, as with <hi>fervencie,</hi> ſo we muſt pray with <hi>reverence,</hi> not having our heads covered, as we ſee many doe: which behaviour, how rude, and unbeſeeming it is, we may eaſily diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne, as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>Offer this kinde of behaviour to thy Lord or Maſter, and ſee whether he will accept it? Mal.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>If thou, having a ſuite to an earthly Prince, dareſt not ſpeake but upon thy knees with all ſubmiſſion; how much more ought we to reverence the Lord God, in compariſon of whom all the Princes in the earth are but <hi>Crickets and Graſhoppers, Eſa.</hi> 40. Therefore the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our prayer to God muſt be in all reverence.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Solomon</hi> prayed upon his knees, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6. <hi>Daniel</hi> fell downe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his knees, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. So did Saint <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 9. So <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 3.14. And not onely men upon earth, but the glorious ſpirits in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven caſt themſelves and their crownes downe before him that <hi>ſits upon the Throne, Apoc.</hi> 4. Yea Jeſus Chriſt the Sonne of God fell downe upon his knees, and prayed to his Father, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>&amp; exauditus prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reverentiam. Heb.</hi> 5. So did <hi>Paul</hi> ſerve God <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.19. Secondly, If we would obtaine any thing at Gods hand, we muſt not onely aske it, but ſeeke for it. He that having prayed, ſits ſtill without adding his endeavour, ſhall not receive the thing he prayes for, for he muſt not onely <hi>orare,</hi> but <hi>lahorare, pro quibus enim o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum, pro eis laborandum eſt:</hi> to this end the Apoſtle would have us <hi>to pull up our faint hands and weake knees, Heb.</hi> 12. And when we have asked grace, we muſt be carefull that we our ſelves be not wanting unto grace, as well as we were carefull that grace ſhould not be wanting unto us.</p>
                           <p>This diligence is noted in the word <hi>petite,</hi> which as it is uſed in the firſt place, ſo alſo it ſignifieth to goe to, or to hit, and knocke: ſo that it containeth all the three vertues that are required unto prayer, but for our inſtruction our Saviour hath expreſſed them in three ſeverall termes.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, having found the <hi>way,</hi> we may not reſt there, there is a <hi>dore</hi> whereby we muſt enter, and that ſhall not ſtand open for us againſt we come, we muſt knocke at it. It pleaſeth God to <hi>entreate us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>to ſeeke and finde us, when we are loſt, Luke</hi> 15. <hi>He ſtands and knockes at our dore, Apoc.</hi> 3. Therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeakes in <hi>Deut. We are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what he doth require at our hands.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſervice that we owe him, is likewiſe to entreate him, to ſeeke for grace at him, to knocke continually, till he open the gate of his mercie. If God heare us not ſo ſoone as we aske, we may not ceaſe to knocke, as <hi>Saul</hi> did, who <hi>becauſe that God anſwered him not, neither by dreames, nor by Urim, nor Prophet, asked counſell of a Witch,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. <hi>Importunity,</hi> as our Saviour ſpeakes <hi>Luke</hi> 11. is a meanes whereby often times men obtaine their ſuites. The unjuſt Judge will be content to heare the Widowes cauſe at length, even becauſe he would bee rid of cumber: if ſhe be earneſt with him, ſhe ſhall at laſt obtaine her ſuite by importunity: So howſoever God be not inclined to doe us good, and have his eares open to our prayers, yet he is much delighted with our importunate ſuites.</p>
                           <p>If the unjuſt Judge that neither feared God, nor reverenced man,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48000:303"/>may be overcome with importunate ſuite, much more will God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge them which give not over their ſuites, but <hi>cry to him night and day, Luke</hi> 18. Let us not be weary of well doing; for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reape, if we faint not.</p>
                           <p>Theſe conditions being performed, that we ſeek <hi>in the deſire of our heart and in humility:</hi> ſecondly, that we be not <hi>wanting to grace, but worke with it:</hi> thirdly, if we doe it with <hi>continuance, not giving over,</hi> then we ſhall finde it true, which Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Omnis qui petit accipit.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſumme is, as when God ſaid, <hi>Seek ye my face, David</hi> anſwered, <hi>Thy face O Lord I will ſeeke, Pſal.</hi> 27. So when Chriſt ſaith to us, <hi>aske;</hi> our anſwer muſt be; we will, at leaſt diſpoſe our ſelves thereunto, eſpecially ſeeing he doth not onely <hi>praeire exemplo;</hi> but <hi>dicere ut petas,</hi> ſeeing he doth not onely by his commandement, <hi>permitiere,</hi> but <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipere ut petas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Laſtly, ſeeing by his promiſe he doth not onely allure them, <hi>ut pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tani,</hi> but doth <hi>minari ſi non petas,</hi> threaten if thou aske not: for if we aske of any but from him, he is angry, as he was with the King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that <hi>required of Baal-zebub when he ſhould recover,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 1. <hi>Is there not a God in Iſrael?</hi> And Chriſt was offended with his Diſciples for the neglect of this duty. <hi>Hitherio ye have asked nothing, Iohn.</hi> 16. And when we come to aske of God, we muſt not ceaſe our ſuite, if he grant us not our ſuite at the firſt; but ſay with <hi>Iacob, Non dimittam te, Gen.</hi> 32. We muſt be <hi>inſtant, as the Canaanite was, Mat.</hi> 15. We muſt be <hi>earneſt,</hi> as he that came <hi>at midnight to borrow bread, Luke</hi> 11. and <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate,</hi> as the <hi>Widow with the Iudge, Luke</hi> 18. and then we may aſſure our ſelves of a comfortable effect of prayers.</p>

                           <p>The Apoſtle begins at our <hi>infirmities,</hi> which he laies downe in ſuch ſort, as wee may plainly ſee that our defects and wants are many: for as there are <hi>infirmities</hi> of the body, which the Scripture calls <hi>the infirmities of Egypt, Deut.</hi> 7.15. Whereunto the Saints of God are ſubject as well as other, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes of <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,</hi> that he had <hi>Crebras infirmitates,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5. So the ſoule alſo hath certaine <hi>infirmities;</hi> and that is the infirinity whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpeaketh; for albeit our ſoule be the ſtronger part, as our Saviour ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit indeed is ſtrong, Matth.</hi> 26. yet it is ſubject to many infirmities, and weakneſſes, when it doubteth of Gods mercies, ſaying: <hi>Will the Lord abſent himſelfe for ever? hath God forgotten to be gracious?</hi> which the Prophet acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth to be ſignes of his infirmities, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77.10. And as the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is weake, ſo there is a <hi>weakneſſe of conſcience,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.7. and no marvel if there be ſuch infirmities in the bodies alſo; for life it ſelfe is but weake, in regard whereof it is ſaid of God, <hi>that hereby hee is content to ſpare us, for that hee remembreth that wee are but duſt,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48000:304"/>Pſal.</hi> 103. and conſidereth, <hi>that we are but even as the wind that paſſeth away, Pſal.</hi> 78.</p>
                           <p>The difference is that, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Haec infirmitas non eſt ad mortem, Joh.</hi> 11. and the dropſie, palſie, and ſuch like diſeaſes, and infirmities of body are not mortall.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond thing which the Apoſtle teacheth is, that howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we be, as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>compaſſed with infirmities, Heb.</hi> 5.5. yet they are not paſt cure, <hi>for the Spirit helpeth our infirmitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </hi> ſo that albeit we are ſubject to fall through weakneſſe, yet <hi>there is hope concerning this thing, Eſay</hi> 10.2. and <hi>our errour may be healed, Dan.</hi> 4. <hi>For there is balme in Gilead, Jer.</hi> 8. which ſerveth to cure all our <hi>ſpirituall diſeaſes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now the cure of the <hi>infirmities</hi> of our ſoule is not performed by any ſtrength of our owne, nor by our owne ſpirit, but by the Spirit of God: for ſo long as our <hi>infirmities</hi> are but bodily, the <hi>ſpirit of man will ſuſtaine them,</hi> and there is helpe to be found; but when the <hi>ſpirit it ſelfe is wounded, then who can help it? Prov.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>The ſpirit of man muſt have helpe from a higher thing then it ſelfe, as from the Spirit of God, which onely is able to mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter helpe.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle aſcribeth to the Spirit of God two benefits, firſt, in regard of the life to come: ſecondly, in reſpect of this preſent life: For the one, as he is the Spirit of Adoption, aſſures us of our eſtate in the life to come; namely, that as God hath adopted us to be his children, ſo we ſhall be fellow-heires with his owne Sonne, of his heavenly kingdome. Touching the other, becauſe we are ſubject in this life, to fall through <hi>infirmitie,</hi> we have this benefit from him, that he ſtayes and upholds us, and therefore is called <hi>ſpiritus</hi>

                           <p>The evill things that we ſhould beare, are not onely afflictions, and the croſſes which we are ſubject to, which the Apoſtle proveth to be more tolerable, becauſe they are not worthy of the glory to come: but <hi>dilatio boni,</hi> wherein we need the vertue of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, becauſe it is a great croſſe, as the Wiſeman ſaith, <hi>Spes quae differtur affligit animam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap> Prov.</hi> 13. Touching which affliction and croſſes, becauſe in this life we cannot obtaine that which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet wiſheth, namely, <hi>to fly away (as it were) with the wings of a dove, that ſowe might be at reſt, Pſal.</hi> 55. therefore we muſt betake our ſelves to the <hi>mourning of the Dove, Eſay</hi> 38. waiting patiently when God will give us time to eſcape.</p>
                           <p>The meanes and wayes whereby the Spirit doth helpe us, are many; but he onely meaneth <hi>prayer;</hi> to teach us, that howſoever it be not eſteemed as it ought, yet it is the chiefe prop, and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall pillar which the holy Ghoſt uſeth to ſtrengthen our weakneſſe.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48000:305"/>Therefore when the Apoſtle willeth, that <hi>firſt of all, prayers and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications ſhould be made for Kings and all in authority,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. the reaſon is, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> noteth, becauſe both mans ſalvation, the honeſty of life, knowledge of the truth, quietneſſe of kingdomes, duties of Kings, and whatſoever tendeth to the publique benefit, commeth by and from <hi>Prayer:</hi> So that not onely the Church, and ſpirituall matters, but the common-wealth, and temporall things are ſtayed upon the pillar of <hi>Prayer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherefore as prayer is aſpeciall helpe: ſo we are not onely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted by religion to uſe it, but nature it ſelfe binds us unto it: for ſo long as we can either deviſe any help of our ſelves, or receive it from any other, ſo long we leane upon our owne ſtaffe; but when all help failes, then we flie to prayer as our laſt refuge: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when God is ſaid to <hi>feed the ravens that call upon him, Pſal.</hi> 147. that cry of theirs is the voyce of nature; ſo that albeit men for a time, leane to their ſtaies and help, yet there is a day, <hi>when all fleſh ſhall be made to come unto him, who onely it is that heareth prayer, Pſal.</hi> 65. that is, <hi>when they lye howling upon their beds, Hoſ.</hi> 7. then they ſhall be faine to call upon God for help: ſo, howſoever <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in the pride of his heart ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould heare his voyce? Exod.</hi> 5. Yet he made him come to him, when he plagued him with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and raine, and haile, which made him <hi>ſend to Moſes and Aaron, that they might pray unto God for him, Exod.</hi> 9.28.</p>
                           <p>But here the Apoſtle meaneth the prayer of the ſpirit, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reckons prayer to be the firſt and chiefeſt help in all trouble, and not the laſt, as the <hi>prayer</hi> of the fleſh doth.</p>
                           <p>Therefore as we muſt diſcerne <hi>ſimulacra virtutum,</hi> from vertues themſelves, and that which is naturall, from that which is of grace; ſo we muſt diſtinguiſh the prayer of the ſpirit, from the carnall prayer; and be ſure that the vertues which we have, if they be any, are not naturall, as thoſe in many of the Heathen, but that they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from grace, and the working of Gods Spirit.</p>
                           <p>To the right framing of our prayer it is required, that we do not onely <hi>orare mente &amp; ſpiritu,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. but as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith of the praiſing of God; ſo we pray to God <hi>with underſtanding, Pſ.</hi> 47. Both our heart, our underſtanding, our affection muſt concurre in making interceſſion to God.</p>
                           <p>For a ſecond point, if prayer be a ſtay to us in our <hi>infirmities,</hi> then we muſt be carefull that our prayers be not faint and weake, but that they proceed from the fervencie and vehemencie of the ſpirit, for as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If the light that is in thee be darkneſſe, how great is that darkneſſe? Matth.</hi> 6. If our prayer be nothing elſe but <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity,</hi> as it is for the moſt part, how great is our infirinity?</p>
                           <p>But the Apoſtle ſheweth our weakneſſe in prayer, in that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyeth men two things: firſt, <hi>that we know not what to pray for:</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that we know not <hi>how to pray:</hi> for both theſe defects we have a double ſupply; for Chriſt, as he is the <hi>light of the world, Joh.</hi> 8. hath directed us what to pray for, by that forme of prayer which he hath preſcribed unto us; and the holy Ghoſt, who is compared
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48000:305"/>to the <hi>wind that bloweth where it will,</hi> inſtructeth us how to pray, for that it ſtirreth up our affections, ſo that we pray with fervencie of ſpirit, and utter our deſires unto God with ſighes that cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed: for as a man that travelleth muſt have a knowledge of his way: ſo he cannot take a journey in hand, except he have a good wind to ſet him forward: to this end we are taught, not onely by the wiſedome of God the Father, what to pray for, but from the power of his Spirit we have thoſe motions kindled in us, whereby our prayer is made fervent.</p>
                           <p>Touching the perſons, whom the Apoſtle chargeth with this two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold ignorance, they are not the common ſort of men, but even the Apoſtles themſelves, for he includes himſelfe in the words, <hi>We know not:</hi> So Chriſt ſaid, not to the Heathen men, <hi>Neſcitis quid pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titis, Matth.</hi> 20. but to his Diſciples, <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John:</hi> ſo that this is generally true of all men, that they know not what to aske, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, as they ought, except Gods Spirit help them.</p>
                           <p>It is true that we have a diffuſed knowledge of good and evill, and a deſire to be partakers of the one, and to be delivered from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for <hi>Ignoti nulla cupido;</hi> but we muſt have a diſtinct knowledge, that is, whether the thing we deſire be good or no: There is an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate of life, which is <hi>contemplative,</hi> and another <hi>Active,</hi> and our infirmity is ſuch, as we know not which of them to take our ſelves unto, but oftentimes we thinke that courſe of life to be good for us, which albeit it be good in it ſelfe, yet turns to our overthrow: ſo that when we deſire of God to place us in any ſuch courſe of life, we ſpeake after the manner of men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. taking it for a contented courſe for our ſelves, whereas it falls not out ſo.</p>
                           <p>This will appeare more plainly, both in things temporall, and ſpirituall. The ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> in their ſuit to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. had a deſire to obtaine ſome good thing at our Saviours hands, and they could not bethinke themſelves of any thing better than to be exalted to ſome place of honour, and therefore deſired that <hi>one of them may fit at his right hand, and the other at his left hand:</hi> but Chriſt told them, <hi>they asked they knew not what,</hi> for honour it not fit for all men: they were the Diſciples of Chriſt, and were to drinke of the cup of affliction, and therefore willed them to be mindfull of it, and not to affect that which was not for their good.</p>
                           <p>Likewiſe in ſpirituall things we may erre, and hereof we have example in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> whom a man would thinke to have know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg enough, ſo that he would not aske the thing that was not good for him; he had the <hi>meſſenger of Sathan ſent to buffet him,</hi> and hee prayed that it might be removed from him, which ſeemeth to have have beene a reaſonable petition, but God anſwered him, that <hi>hee asked he knew not what;</hi> it was more neceſſary for him to be exerciſed withthe temptations, then not: and vvhereas he deſires to be ſo pure, as not once to be driven to evill; God told him, that <hi>his grace was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for him, for it was his will to perfect his ſtrength in his weakneſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Therefore if vve have any revelation from <hi>fleſh and blood, Matth.</hi> 6. that perſvvadeth us, that this or that is good for us, vve
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48000:306"/>muſt know that all ſuch are falſe, and that we muſt ſuffer our ſelves to be directed by Gods Spirit, who knoweth better what is good for us, then we our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>But to the end that we ſhould not erre, the Spirit of God maketh interceſſion for us, and therefore we may be ſure, that although <hi>we know not how to pray, in ſuch ſort as may pleaſe God;</hi> yet the Spirit of God, who knoweth the ſecrets of the counſell of God, will make that prayer for us, which ſhall be both for our good, and alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>It cannot be verified of the holy Ghoſt, which is God, that hee either prayeth or groaneth, but the Apoſtles meaning is, that he makes us to make interceſſion, and hath that operation in our hearts, that he makes us to groane. So when the Apoſtle, <hi>Galat.</hi> 4.6. ſayes, that <hi>the Spirit cries Abba, Father,</hi> his meaning is, that <hi>by it</hi> wee cry <hi>Abba, Father, Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
                           <p>Againe, the Spirit is ſaid to <hi>make interceſsion</hi> for us, becauſe it <hi>ſheds abroad the love of God in our hearts, Rom.</hi> 5. for from the love of God proceeds this love and affection in us, that we deſire him and all his bleſſings, and therefore make our prayers to him to that end, which is nothing elſe, but <hi>explicatio deſiderii:</hi> ſo that we do not ſo ſoone deſire any good thing, but we are ready to pray for it: So ſayes the Prophet, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt my deſire, and my groaning is not hid from thee, Pſal.</hi> 36.</p>
                           <p>Likewiſe when our deſire is delayed, ſo that we obtaine not the thing wee would have, then wee are caſt into ſorrow, which is wrought in us by the Spirit which is in us, and by prayer; for it is the Spirit of God which kindleth this fervencie of deſire in prayer, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Tepida eſt omnis oratio, quam non praevenit inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio,</hi> every prayer is luke-warme, which is not prevented with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
                           <p>The firſt thing that the Spirit of God workes in us, is, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth our hearts to pray to God for the good which wee lacke, which is a thing not in our owne power; and therefore <hi>David</hi> thankes God <hi>that he found in his heart to pray,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7. for when we would ſettle our ſelves to pray, <hi>Nihil tam longè abeſt à nobis, quàm orare ut decet.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now being thus untoward in our ſelves, the Spirit of God comes and helps our infirmitie, and as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>He opens our hearts to pray:</hi> By this meanes it comes to paſſe, that a man having his affections cold, ſhall on a ſudden feele in himſelfe a deſire to pray, and ſhall ſay, <hi>Domine, paratum eſt cor meum, Pſal.</hi> 108.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, whereas the Lord ſaith, <hi>Open thy mouth and I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 87. We find this infirmity in our ſelves, that when wee have found an heart to pray, yet we cannot open our mouthes: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Open thou my lips, Pſal.</hi> 51. and ſo muſt we ſue to Chriſt, that he will give us words to ſpeake; for God hath a key both to our tongue and will.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, having begun to pray, that falls out many times which <hi>David</hi> complaines of, <hi>Cor meum dereliquit me, Pſal.</hi> 40. So our heart
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48000:306"/>will be gone, and our mind will be wandring abroad, not regarding what our tongue ſpeakes.</p>
                           <p>It falls out often, that as <hi>Abraham</hi> had his ſacrifice ready, he was no ſooner gone from it, but <hi>the fowles of the aire did light upon it, Gen.</hi> 15. So while we offer up to God the <hi>calves of our lips, Hoſ.</hi> 14. and <hi>our courſe is paſt, Pſal.</hi> 141. it comes to paſſe through our wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe many foule thoughts be got upon our ſacrifice, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoyle it; and the remedie that the ſpirit of God affords us againſt this infirmity, is, that it calls us home, and tels us, we are kneeling before the Majeſty of God, and therefore ought to take heed what we ſpeake in his preſence. Therefore <hi>Bernard</hi> to keepe his mind in the meditation of God, when he would pray began thus, <hi>Let God ariſe, and let all his enemies be ſcattered, Pſal.</hi> 68. and <hi>Auguſtine</hi> to the ſame purpoſe began thus, <hi>Save mee, O God, for the waters over-flow, Pſal.</hi> 64.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, though we have our meditation ſtill on God, yet wee ſhall find in our ſelves, that our ſpirits are dull and heavie, and have no manner of vigour to help our infirmity; herein the Spirit helps and puts theſe meditations in our hearts, whereby it kindleth, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>a fire burning within us:</hi> ſo that God ſhall be faine to ſay to us, as he did to <hi>Moſes, Dimitte me, let mee alone, Exod.</hi> 32.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, albeit we pray but faintly, and have not that ſupply of fervencie that is required in prayer, yet we have comfort, that ever when we moſt faint in prayer, there are of Gods Saints that pray for us with all inſtancie, by which it comes to paſſe, that being all but one body, their prayers tend to our good as well as their owne, for the faithfull, howſoever they be many, and diſperſed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers corners of the world, yet they are but one dowe; and as they are the members of one body, ſo they pray not privately for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for the whole body of the Church: ſo that the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of one member is ſupplyed by the fervent and earneſt prayer of the other. Therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>The Spirit maketh interceſsion for us, gemitibus inenarrabilibus, Auguſtine</hi> asketh, what groanings are theſe? are they thine, or mine? no; they are the groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Church, ſometime in Mee, ſometime in Thee, and therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> (to ſhew that the Miniſters of God do the people no leſſe good when they pray for them, then when they teach them) ſaid, <hi>God forbid I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you, and ſo ſinne againſt God,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. for he was an help to them, not onely in preaching to them, but in offering burnt offerings for them. Therefore the people pray to <hi>Eſay, Lift thou up thy prayer for us,</hi> For as the offering of the Miniſter is to put the people in mind, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. ſo they are Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrancers: they are Angels as well <hi>aſcending</hi> upwards by their prayer in the behalfe of the people, as <hi>deſcending</hi> to teach them the will of God.</p>
                           <p>But if the Spirit that quailes in us, do quaile alſo in the whole Church; yet we have a ſupply from the teares, which our head Chriſt <hi>ſhed on his Church, Luk.</hi> 19.41. and from the ſtrong cries which he uttered to God his Father, in <hi>the daies of his fleſh, Heb.</hi> 5.7.
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48000:307"/>by which he ceaſeth not to make requeſt to God ſtill for us, ſo that albeit the hardneſſe of our heart be ſuch as we cannot pray for our ſelves, nor the Church for us, yet we may ſay, <hi>Conqueror tibi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, lachrymis Jeſu Chriſti.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Laſtly, becauſe we cannot pray, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, we have two helpes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in that behalfe from the Spirit: firſt, that the Spirit teacheth us to ſubmit our will unto Gods will, becauſe as we are men, ſo we ſpeake <hi>after the manner of men, Rom.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>This ſubmiſſion we learne from the example of Chriſt his prayer to God his Father, <hi>Tranſeat calix iſle à me, Let this cup paſſe from mee; yet not my will, but thy will be done, Matth.</hi> 26. So <hi>David</hi> qualified his deſire, <hi>If I have found favour with the Lord, he will bring mee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, but if not, let him do what ſeemeth good to himſeife,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, when wee looke backe upon our prayer, and ſee, that by reaſon of want of fervencie and zeale, it is but <hi>ſmoaking flaxe,</hi> then the Spirit ſtirreth us up to deſire God, that according to his promiſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42. <hi>He will not quench it,</hi> but that <hi>his grace may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for us, and that he will make perfect his ſtrength in our weakneſſe,</hi> 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>The other thing wherein the Spirit helpeth our <hi>infirmities,</hi> is, that he worketh in our hearts <hi>certaine groanes that cannot be expreſſed,</hi> which is a plaine oppoſition to drouſie and ſloathfull prayer: for a devout prayer, <hi>plus conſtat gemitibus, quàm ſermonibus;</hi> it is not fine phraſes and goodly ſentences, that commend our prayer, but the fervencie of the ſpirit from whom it proceeds.</p>
                           <p>It is well if wee doe <hi>orare mente &amp; ſpiritu,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. but if our prayers do draw out <hi>ſighs</hi> and <hi>groanings</hi> from our hearts, it is the better, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>r then it appeares that our prayer is not a breath, comming from the lungs, but from the very depth of the heart, as the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt ſaies of his prayer, <hi>De profundis, out of the deepes have I cryed to thee, O Lord, Pſal.</hi> 130.</p>
                           <p>What the Apoſtle meaneth by <hi>groanings which cannot be expreſſed,</hi> is plaine, for when the griefe of the heart is greateſt, then are wee leaſt able to utter it, as appeares by the <hi>Shunamite,</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 4. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding as it was God that wakened in us the deſire of good things; ſo though we be not able to utter them in words, yet hee doth heare, <hi>etiam vocem in ſilentio.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There are <hi>mutae preces, &amp; tamen clamantes:</hi> ſuch as are the ſilent prayers of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which he made in his heart to God, though hee expreſſed it not in words; to this God ſaid, <hi>Cur clamas ad me? Exod.</hi> 14.</p>
                           <p>Now as <hi>Martha</hi> was loath to ſerve alone, and therefore would have <hi>Mary</hi> to <hi>helpe her, Luk.</hi> 10. So the ſpirit doth not <hi>pray alone,</hi> but doth <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>beares together, or helpes us,</hi> whereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle gives us to underſtand, that man muſt have a co-operation with Gods Spirit. So we ſee the Saints of God, albeit they acknowledge prayer to be the work of Gods Spirit in them; for as much as we are not able to <hi>call Jeſus Lord, but by the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Yet they are not themſelves idle, but do adde endeavour, as <hi>David, Lord open
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48000:307"/>thou my lips:</hi> So he affirmes of himſelfe; <hi>I have opened my lips, and drew in my breath, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>But that we may have the help of Gods Spirit (without which our endeavour is but vaine) wee muſt ſtill thinke upon our owne weakneſſe, and humble our ſelves in the ſight of God, as the <hi>Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. So the Spirit of God will reſt upon us, as the Lord <hi>promiſeth, Eſay</hi> 66. For this end <hi>faſting</hi> is commended to the Church, for it hath beene an uſe alwaies among the faithfull, to <hi>humble their ſoules with faſting, Pſal.</hi> 35.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, as we muſt pray in faith, ſo we muſt alſo be charitably affected to our brethren, firſt, by <hi>forgiving them,</hi> if we will have <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe</hi> at the hands of our <hi>heavenly Father, Mar.</hi> 11.25. Secondly, by giving them that need; this commended <hi>Cornelius</hi> his prayer, that he <hi>gave almes, Act.</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>If our prayer be thus qualified, we ſhall have Gods Spirit to aſſiſt us in prayer; whoſe help if we obtaine, and unto our prayer adde a patient expectation, ſo that we be not in haſt to obtaine the thing we crave, but we wait upon Gods leaſure, as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Qui crediderit, non feſtinabit, Eſay</hi> 28. <hi>He that beleeveth makes not haſt,</hi> thus we ſhall find that the Lord will not caſt out our prayer.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>But then wee meete with another difficulty, and that is as <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that albeit grace may be obtained at the hands of God by prayer; yet we know not <hi>how or what to aske, except the Spirit of God ſupply our infirmities:</hi> and therefore as then it was ſaid, <hi>that as the Spirit of God maketh interceſsion for us,</hi> ſo here the ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit doth move the Diſciples to <hi>ſeeke for a forme of prayer of Chriſt,</hi> whereby we are taught, that if we know not how or what to pray for, our duty is to repaire to Chriſt, with the Diſciples, that he would direct us.</p>
                           <p>This Text hath two parts: firſt, <hi>the Petition of the Apoſtles;</hi> ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Chriſts anſwer thereunto,</hi> verſ. 2.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt part we are to conſider, firſt, <hi>the occaſion of the Petition:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>the petition it ſelfe, Domine doce nos.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Touching the firſt point, the Diſciples tooke occaſion of this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from Chriſt praying, for ſeeing him not onely pray now, but at ſundry other times, preſently they conceived thus within themſelves, that doubtleſſe prayer was a matter of great inportance, and a meanes of no ſmall benefit, otherwiſe Chriſt would never have prayed ſo often.</p>
                           <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48000:308"/>
                           <p>Before we conſidered two ſpeciall <hi>motives</hi> to prayer: The firſt was <hi>Chriſts commandement:</hi> the ſecond <hi>Chriſts promiſe, Matth.</hi> 7.7. <hi>Aske and it ſhall be given you;</hi> and here againe we have other two <hi>motives:</hi> firſt, the <hi>provocation of Chriſts example,</hi> whom the Diſciples found praying in a certaine place: ſecondly, the <hi>mould and ſet form of prayer,</hi> which he hath given us for our better direction, in this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Say, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning the firſt of theſe, no doubt the examples of holy men ought to move us to pray, much more when Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, who is the <hi>Holy of Holies, Dan.</hi> 9.24. doth by his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtirre us up hereunto.</p>
                           <p>King <hi>David,</hi> when he had his Crowne pulled off his head, by his owne ſonne, and was driven out of his Kingdome, ſaid to the Prieſt, <hi>If it pleaſe God he can bring mee againe, and ſhew mee both the Arke, and the Tabernacle,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.25. Declaring hereby, that he was more carefull to have the liberty to come into the houſe of prayer, to powre out his ſupplication before the Lord, as hee was wont, then to be reſtored to his Crown, ſo great account did he make of prayer. The like account did the holy Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> make, for when by the commandement of the King it was proclamed, that whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made any petition to God or men, ſave onely to the King, ſhould be <hi>throwne into the Lyons Denne;</hi> he choſe rather to adventure his life, then not to pray, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. Whereby we may gather, both how acceptable to God, and alſo how neceſſary for us, this duty of prayer, and invocation is: So that theſe examples of theſe holy men, ought to be of no ſmall efficacie to perſwade us hereunto; and eſpecially if we conſider the example of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who is greater then either <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Daniel.</hi> Of whom it is reported, that he went into a <hi>ſolitary place alone,</hi> not onely in the <hi>morning, Mark.</hi> 1. but alſo in the <hi>evening, Joh.</hi> 6. not for an <hi>houre,</hi> but to ſpend the <hi>whole night</hi> in prayer, <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.12. he prayed not onely <hi>in deſerto,</hi> which was a place of diſtreſſe, but in <hi>horto, Joh.</hi> 18.2. which was a place of pleaſure: as hee prayed when hee was in his agony, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.46. ſo alſo, when he was to be made King, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. to teach us, that as well in proſperity as in adverſity, we have need to pray, for hereunto our Saviour doth exhort us in plaine words, not onely by precept, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Luk.</hi> 21.40. <hi>Pray that yee enter not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> becauſe prayer is a meane to keepe us from evill, both <hi>à malo culpae, &amp; à malo poenae;</hi> as well from ſinne, as from all manner of plagues, which are the <hi>effects of ſinne;</hi> as one ſaith, there would none <hi>adverſity</hi> come upon us, unleſſe there were <hi>perverſity</hi> in us: but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by promiſe of reward, <hi>Pray unto your Father in ſecret, and he will reward you openly, Matth.</hi> 6.6.</p>
                           <p>We think it ſufficient if earthly Princes will vouchſafe to hearken to our prayer; but God promiſeth us more, he will reward us for the ſame. Therefore ſeing God both commands us to pray, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to grant us that we pray for: ſeeing he doth not only by his example teach us, that <hi>Prayer is requiſite,</hi> but preſcribes us alſo a <hi>Form of Prayer;</hi> we ought not to be negligent in this duty.</p>
                           <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48000:309"/>
                           <p>Beſides, out of this occaſion, we are to conſider this, That Chriſt prayed though he needed nothing, as hee was the onely begotten Sonne of God, he was <hi>full of grace and truth, Joh.</hi> 1.16. Hee had <hi>received the Spirit without meaſure, Joh.</hi> 3. Yet for all that he prayed.</p>
                           <p>There are three uſes of prayer: Firſt, there is an <hi>Uſe of Neceſsity:</hi> for God hath left prayer to be our City of reſuge, to the end, that when all meanes faile, wee ſhould ſlie unto God by prayer. In which regard the Wiſe man ſaith, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18. <hi>Turris altiſsima eſt nomen Domini.</hi> But Chriſtians ſhould have a further uſe of this duty: for unreaſonable creatures, as Lyons, and Ravens, are provoked (in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of their neceſſity) to call upon God.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the <hi>Uſe of Duty:</hi> for prayer is an offering: The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet compareth it to <hi>Incenſe, Pſal.</hi> 41. a <hi>Reaſonable ſervice, Rom.</hi> 12. Our <hi>Spirituall ſacrifice,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. It is compared to <hi>Incenſe,</hi> which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth a ſweete ſmell to all our <hi>workes, words,</hi> and <hi>thougths,</hi> which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would ſtinke, and be offenſive to the Majeſty of God. This uſe of prayer we have not onely for the ſupply of our wants in the time of adverſity, but <hi>at all times,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 27.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, there is the <hi>Uſe of Dignity,</hi> when a man doth abſtract himſelfe from the earth, and by often prayer doth grow into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and familiarity with God: for this is a great <hi>Dignity,</hi> that fleſh and blood ſhall be exalted ſo much, as to have continuall conference with God.</p>
                           <p>Now as Chriſt was the Sonne of God, he had no cauſe to pray in any of theſe three reſpects, but as he was <hi>Principium omnis crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turae, Col.</hi> 1. as he was <hi>the head of the Church, Eph.</hi> 1. he had uſe of prayer in theſe three reſpects: as he was a creature, he ſtood in need of thoſe things, which other creatures of God were wont to deſire. Againe, as he was a creature, though the chiefe of all creatures, hee ought this duty of <hi>Invocation</hi> unto God his Creator: and as hee called on God in theſe two reſpects, ſo he was heard, as Chriſt ſpeakes; <hi>I know thou heareſt mee alwaies, Joh.</hi> 11.41. But as he was in the ſtate of a Creature, the laſt uſe doth moſt of all concerne him; for which cauſe having told <hi>Martha,</hi> that <hi>one thing was needfull, Luk.</hi> 10. becauſe the obtaining of the ſame is not in our power, hee preſently withdraweth himſelfe unto prayer in the beginning of this Chapter, teaching us to do the like.</p>
                           <p>Before we come to the <hi>Petition,</hi> theſe words <hi>ut ceſſavit,</hi> are to be conſidered: for there are ſome with <hi>Saul, will call for the Arke,</hi> and will preſently cry, <hi>Away with it,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. that is, will begin their prayers, and will breake them off in the midſt upon any occaſion: but the Spirit of God doth teach us to be of another mind, when he willeth us to avoid whatſoever may be a meanes to <hi>interrupt our prayer,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>The Diſciples forbare to make their petitions to Chriſt, till hee had done praying, and therefore from their example we are to learne, ſo to ſettle our ſelves to prayer, as that nothing ſhould cauſe us to breake off, and ſo to regard others that are occupied in this duty, as by no meanes to interrupt them.</p>
                           <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48000:309"/>
                           <p>In the Petition we are to conſider, firſt, <hi>the thing that they deſire:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>the reaſon why they make this Petition.</hi> Firſt, whereas they make requeſt that Chriſt would teach them how to pray, they do by implication acknowledge as much as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. that they <hi>know not what to aske:</hi> not that they were without that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall inſtitution which we have from nature, that is, to deſire that which is good, but becauſe they know not how to limit their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire: as in temporall things, they know not whether it were good for them to be the <hi>Chiefe men in a Kingdome;</hi> that was the ignorance of the ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee, Matth.</hi> 20.</p>
                           <p>In ſpirituall matters they will be like Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. who thought it good for him to be <hi>ſaved from the temptation,</hi> whereas God told him, that <hi>his grace was ſufficient for him;</hi> and yet that the temptation ſhould continue ſtill.</p>
                           <p>As <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> made a requeſt ignorantly for themſelves, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. So they make another in the behalfe of Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9. <hi>Lord, wilt thou that wee command that ſire come downe from Heaven?</hi> and therefore were reproved by Chriſt for it: and as we ſee both by examples of Chriſts owne Diſciples, that <hi>we may pray amiſſe, Jam.</hi> 4. So in the old Teſtament, <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>We may pray ſo, as prayer</hi> (which is a part of Gods ſervice) <hi>ſhall be turned into ſinne, Pſalm.</hi> 109. For prayer is nothing elſe but an interpreter of our deſire, as one ſaith: <hi>Ea petimus quae appetimus:</hi> and as our deſires are many times not onely <hi>vaine and unproſitable,</hi> but <hi>dangerous and hurtfull:</hi> ſo it fals out likewiſe, that our prayers are vaine, and ſo are turned into ſinne.</p>
                           <p>The Diſciples therefore being privie to their owne infirmities in this caſe, are ſtirred up by Gods Spirit, to ſeeke for a perfect forme of prayer of Chriſt, in whom <hi>all the treaſures of wiſedome and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are hid, Col.</hi> 2. And this they do to the end they might not faile, either in the matter, or manner of their prayers, and that, having received a platforme of prayer from Chriſt, they might uſe it as a patterne and complement of all their petitions.</p>
                           <p>The Phariſees were great prayers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. but they <hi>under a pretence of long prayers did devour Widows houſes, Matth.</hi> 23. and therefore their prayers turned into ſinne. The Heathen uſed alſo to make long prayers, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.7. but they erred, for they thonght that they ſhould be heard for their <hi>long babling.</hi> Therefore the Diſciples, that they might not pray amiſſe, do make their requeſt to our Saviour: <hi>Lord teach us to pray:</hi> which Petition was therefore acceptable to Chriſt, becauſe profitable for themſelves: for thus he profeſſeth of himſelfe: <hi>Ego Dominus Deus tuus, docens te utilia, Eſay</hi> 48.17. Not <hi>ſubtilia,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſt.</hi>) So Saint <hi>Paul</hi> confirmeth, that <hi>he with-held nothing from the Church, that was profitable for them to know, Act.</hi> 20.</p>
                           <p>The world is full of curious queſtions: The Phariſees move que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions <hi>totching matrimony.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Sadduces asked, what ſhould come to paſſe after the end of the world, <hi>whether we ſhall know one another, Matth.</hi> 22. Theſe were unprofitable and curious, the inventions of fleſh and blood, not thoſe that proceeded from the holy Ghoſt: The Diſciples queſtion
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48000:310"/>is here, how they may ſerve God, and how they may performe that duty, for which they came into the world; <hi>Curious</hi> things are thoſe <hi>abſcondita,</hi> which belong to God, with which <hi>we may not meddle, Deut.</hi> 29. we muſt enquire of things which concerne us. Of the ſons of <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abell,</hi> who were inventors of tents, ſome deviſed <hi>to worke in braſſe and copper:</hi> others <hi>found out Muſicke,</hi> as they thought it moſt profitable for the publique-weale. The trade that the ſons of <hi>Seth</hi> uſed and profeſſed at the ſame time, that they thought to be moſt profitable, was <hi>the calling upon the name of the Lord, Gen.</hi> 4. and they were occupied therein, as an Art no leſſe profitable then the building of houſes, or making of armour; and ever ſince howſoever the worldido addict themſelves to other things, that ſerve to make moſt for their private profit: yet the Church and City of God are buſie in ſtudying how they may by prayer receive mercy, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine grace, to help them in time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon whereby they urge their ſuit is, <hi>as John taught his Diſciples;</hi> which reaſon in the judgement of fleſh and blood, might ſeeme of ſmall efficacie; for whereas <hi>John</hi> confeſſed himſelfe <hi>unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to unlooſe Chriſts ſhooe, Mat.</hi> 3. he might have tooke it in ſcorne that the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> ſhould teach him his duty after the example of <hi>John:</hi> but Chriſt to commend his humility, is content both in his preaching and praying to follow <hi>John: John</hi> ſaid, <hi>Every tree that brings not forth good fruit, Matth.</hi> 3. And Chriſt, though he were the <hi>wiſedome of God,</hi> and furniſhed with all manner of doctrine, yet was content to borrow that ſentence from <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> as appeareth in his Sermon, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. So he was content to follow him in prayer; So that the example of <hi>Johns</hi> diligence in teaching his Diſciples that duty was a motive to him to do the like unto him.</p>
                           <p>Whereas the Diſciples of Chriſt tell him, that <hi>John</hi> was wont to teach his Diſciples to pray, they ſpeake by experience, for divers of them were before-time Diſciples unto <hi>John,</hi> as appears <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.37.</p>
                           <p>The ordinary prayer that was uſed in the Synagogue among the Jewes, was that prayer which is intituled <hi>the prayer of Moſes, Pſal.</hi> 90. and as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Law and the Prophets were untill John, Luk.</hi> 16. So that prayer of <hi>Moſes</hi> continued in the Church of the Jewes, untill <hi>Johns</hi> time; when he was come, he uſed another forme of prayer which endured to the comming of Chriſt, who having taught his Diſciples a third forme of prayer, <hi>Johns</hi> prayer ceaſed; the reaſon was, becauſe as the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of <hi>Moſes, Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>Albeit both Moſes, the Prophets, and John, were faithfull in the houſe of God, yet they were but ſervants, but Chriſt was that Sunne of righteouſneſſe, and the day-ſtarre, that was long before promiſed, and therefore ſeeing he being come, hath taught a more perfect forme of prayer, hee beeing onely wiſe, all other formes ought to give place to his.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, according to the rule of <hi>John Baptiſt, a man can receive nothing except it be given him from above, Joh.</hi> 3.2. Then if wee will obtaine any thing, we muſt put up our ſupplications to God for it; but in making our prayers we may offend: for <hi>he that is of the earth is earthly,</hi> and ſpeakes earthly things: Therefore <hi>John,</hi> according to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48000:310"/>his owne confeſſion, may mingle ſome corruption with his prayer: But <hi>Chriſt that is from heaven is above all, Joh.</hi> 3. and therefore if he teach us to pray, it ſhall be in ſuch ſort as God ſhall accept it: and for this cauſe Chriſts prayer doth excell the prayers both of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and all the Prophets.</p>
                           <p>Touching which forme of prayer, as before he had given them <hi>an abridgement</hi> of that <hi>obedience,</hi> which the law requireth, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16. So here he doth briefly ſet downe a <hi>forme</hi> of prayer.</p>
                           <p>As it is ſaid of him, that <hi>grace and truth is by Jeſus Chriſt, Joh.</hi> 1. ſo when in the other Chapter, he had ſhewed them the truth of the Law: ſo now he tels them that grace muſt be ſought for of God by prayer, whereby wee may be able to obey that Law.</p>
                           <p>The ſuit of the Diſciples being both profitable to themſelves, and no ſubtile queſtion, Chriſt is content preſently to grant their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and therefore his anſwer is, <hi>When yee pray, ſay, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherein we are to obſerve two things: firſt, whereas there are certaine practicke ſpirits, that croſſe that ſaying of our Saviour, and tell us, we may not uſe this prayer which Chriſt gave, ſaying, <hi>Our Father:</hi> but that we are to frame our prayers of our owne, as our ſtate ſhall require, theſe words are a contradiction to their <hi>ne dicite.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Chriſt himſelfe hath commanded us to uſe this forme of prayer; and therefore we may be bold to ſay: <hi>Our Father;</hi> whatſoever pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers we make of our ſelves, they have ſome earth, becauſe wee our ſelves are of the earth; but the prayer inſtituted by Chriſt is free from all imperfection, becauſe it was penned from him that was <hi>from above, Joh.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>In this prayer there is not one word wanting, that ſhould be put in, nor any word more then ought to be. Therefore both in regard of the <hi>Author</hi> of it, and the <hi>Matter,</hi> we may ſafely uſe this forme of Prayer.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, theſe words are an oppoſition betwixt <hi>Cogitate,</hi> and <hi>Dicite.</hi> It is not enough <hi>to thinke in our minds</hi> this prayer, but our prayers muſt be <hi>Vocal;</hi> ſo that, as in this Chriſt caſteth out the dumbe devill; ſo here he caſteth out the dumbe prayer. It is true, that the life of prayer and thankſgiving ſtandeth herein, <hi>That we ſing praiſes with under ſtanding, Pſal.</hi> 47. that we do <hi>or are mente &amp; ſpiritu,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. Herein ſtands the ſoule of prayer; but as we our ſelves have not onely a ſoule, but a body alſo: ſo our prayer muſt have a body: <hi>Our tongue muſt be the penne of a ready writer, Pſalm.</hi> 45. We muſt at the time of prayer, <hi>bow our knees,</hi> as our Saviour Chriſt did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.41. We muſt <hi>lift up our hearts with our hands, Lam.</hi> 3. Our eyes muſt be lift <hi>up to God, that dwelleth in the heaven, Pſ.</hi> 123. And as <hi>David</hi> ſayes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135. <hi>All our bones muſt be exerciſed in prayer.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The reaſon why we muſt uſe this forme of prayer, is taken from the skill of him that hath penned it, and from his favour with God.</p>
                           <p>We are not acquainted with the phraſes of the Court, and we know not what ſure to make unto God. But Chriſt, who is our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate, in whom <hi>all treaſures of wiſedome and knowledge are hid, Col.</hi> 2.
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48000:311"/>He can forme us a bill, and make ſuch a petition for us, as ſhall be acceptable at the hands of <hi>God: None knowes the things of God, but the Spirit of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. So none knowes what pleaſeth God, but Chriſt, who hath received the Spirit from God: and in this regard, as he knowes Gods will beſt, ſo he is beſt able to frame a forme of prayer, ſo as it may be agreeable to Gods will.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, touching the <hi>Authority</hi> which Chriſt hath with God his Father; it was ſuch as God proclamed from Heaven: <hi>This is my beloved Sonne:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Thou heareſt mee alwayes, Joh.</hi> 11. So greatly was he reſpected with God.</p>
                           <p>In both theſe reſpects we may be bold to ſay, <hi>Our Father, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We have the promiſe, <hi>that if we aske any thing in the name of Chriſt, he gives it us, Joh.</hi> 16.17. Much more may we have confidene to be heard, <hi>Si non modo in nomine ejus, ſed verbis ejus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If I had the tongue of Men and Angels,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. His meaning is, that the tongues of Angels were more glorious then the tongues of men; and therefore that ſong of the Angels, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Eſay</hi> 6. is magnified in the Church: But this prayer was formed by the tongue of Chriſt, who is the Lord of Angels.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Cherubims hid their faces before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                           <p>This prayer, as one ſaid, is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

And this prayer is <hi>breviarium fidei,</hi> it teacheth us to beleeve thoſe things which we pray for.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, our perfection in obeying the Law, and in beleeving thoſe things which we ought to intreat, with ſuch a hope by prayer: <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem implendi, &amp; legem credendi, lex ſtatuit ſupplicandi.</hi>

                           <p>Concerning prayer, among other things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noted, we te to know, that it is the doctrine of the Fathers; that God not prayed unto on our parts, and his holy Spirit not yet poſſeſſing our ſoules, hath notwithſtanding promiſed, <hi>that he w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Namely, that Spirit which he cals the <hi>Spirit of Grace and Prayer, Zach.</hi> 12.10.</p>
                           <p>When he thus vouchſafeth to ſend the Spirit of Grace into our ſoules, then from thence there doe runne two ſtreames into the two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall faculties of our ſoule, that is, the Spirit of Grace hath a work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our <hi>Vnderſtanding</hi> by the light of Faith: and ſecondly, in our <hi>Will,</hi> by inſpiring us with holy deſires: of which holy deſires, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter betwixt us and God, is <hi>Prayer:</hi> For that as the Apoſtle ſpeaks: <hi>Our requeſts are made knowne to God by prayer and ſupplication, Phil.</hi> 4.6.</p>
                           <p>Now as prayer is properly the effect of Grace; ſo whatſoever wee obtaine of God by prayer, it is the gift of Grace; which prayer is therefore our reaſonable ſervice of God, becauſe we doe therein ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, not onely our owne wants and unworthineſſe, but alſo that as God hath in his hands all manner of bleſſings to beſtow upon us; ſo <hi>if we ſue to him for them, he will with hold no good thing from us. Pſal.</hi> 84.12.</p>
                           <p>Before we can pray for good things, it is required, that we doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a love of them; which if it be in us, then we ſhall not onely bee inflamed with a deſire of them, which is an effect of love, but ſhall be ſtirred up to pray for them: But it is the peculiar worke of the <hi>holy Ghoſt, to ſhed in our hearts the love,</hi> not onely <hi>of God, Rom.</hi> 5. but of all
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48000:312"/>other good things, which work he performeth, not in all in differently; for he is compared to the <hi>Wind, that bloweth where it will, Ioh.</hi> 3. But thoſe whom it pleaſeth the holy Ghoſt to inſpire with a love and affection towards good things, they doe not onely deſire them, but withall doe pray earneſtly for them unto God; for as it is the worke of Jeſus Chriſt, the eternall Word, to enlighten every one that commeth into the world, ſo it is the office of the eternall Spirit, to inſpire our hearts with holy deſires.</p>
                           <p>In this anſwer of our Saviour, we are to conſider three points: firſt, <hi>a time limited for prayer:</hi> ſecondly, <hi>the contents of the word, Oratio:</hi> thirdly, <hi>what is to be noted out of the word, Diſcue.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Touching the time limited for prayer, we have heard already, that there are three uſes of prayer, one was the uſe of <hi>dignity and perſection,</hi> when men doe converſe and enter into familiarity with God, by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting their mindes from humane affaires, and ſublevating them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Heaven by a continuall meditation of God, and things pertaining to the life to come, which becauſe it is peculiar to them that have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready attained to ſome perfection, we muſt ſay of it, as Chriſt did of another matter: <hi>Qui po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>eſt capere capiat, Matth.</hi> 19. Our weakneſſe is ſuch, as cannot by any meanes come to this uſe; yea the infirmity of the Diſciples themſelves was ſo great, that albeit Chriſt had ſo many other things to tell them of, yet <hi>they were not able as yet to beare them, Iohn</hi> 14.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we are to conſider the two other uſes, which doe more neerely concerne us; whereof the one is, the <hi>Vſe of neceſsity,</hi> which ſtandeth either upon feare, or upon want; and when neceſſity lyeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, in either of theſe reſpects, they are ſo forcible, that they make <hi>all fleſh to come unto him that heareth prayer, Pſal.</hi> 65. <hi>Of feare</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſaith: <hi>Lord in trouble they viſited thee, they powred out a prayer when thychaſtening was upon them, Iſa.</hi> 26.16. And the want of outward things is ſo vehement a motive, as when nothing elſe can move men to prayer, yet they will <hi>aſſemble themſelves before the Lord for corne and oyle, Hoſ.</hi> 7.14.</p>
                           <p>Theſe two, the one being as <hi>Solomon</hi> termeth it, <hi>Plaga cordis,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 5. the other, <hi>Defiderium cordis, Pſal.</hi> 5. doe point to us two times of prayer; namely, when either we are oppreſſed with miſery, <hi>as the effect of ſinne,</hi> or diſquieted with our ſelves with the <hi>conſcience,</hi> and <hi>guilt of ſinne it ſelfe,</hi> which is the cauſe of all our miſeries.</p>
                           <p>Touching ſinne, the Prophet ſaith, <hi>While I held my tongue, my bones conſumed away;</hi> but <hi>after he had confeſſed his ſinnes unto the Lord,</hi> and craved pardon, <hi>he forgave his wickedneſſe:</hi> And becauſe it is not his caſe onely, for as much as we have all ſinned, his counſell is in this behalfe; <hi>pro hoc orabit omnis pius, Pſal.</hi> 32. Which being done, as the Prophet ſpeaketh, the weakeſt of them, that is, every ſinner, ſhall be as <hi>David:</hi> Neither are we of neceſſity to pray, that God will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the guilt of our ſinnes paſt, but that he will prevent us with his grace againſt temptations of ſinnes to come; for in this regard, our Saviour Chriſt would have his Diſciples occupie themſelves in this holy duty, <hi>Orate, Pray ye that ye enter not into temptation, Luke</hi> 22. <hi>For
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48000:312"/>the effect of ſinne,</hi> which is adverſity.</p>
                           <p>Then is prayer neceſſary in the time of affliction, when outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the malice of our enemies we are in miſery: In which caſe the Prophet ſaith: when the ungodly, for the love he bare to them, requited him with hatred, <hi>Then he gave himſelfe to prayer. Pſal.</hi> 109.3. Or elſe inwardly, by reaſon of croſſes, which it pleaſeth God to bring upon us, againſt which, the onely remedy is to <hi>uſe prayer,</hi> as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle exhorts, <hi>Iames</hi> 5. <hi>Is any afflicted? let him pray. A timore iuo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepimus ſpiritum ſalutis, Eſa.</hi> 26.8. That is, <hi>for feare.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And when we conſider our owne wants, the troubles that are upon us, though for a time we hold our tongues and ſpeake nothing, yet a fire will kindle in us, we cannot long be ſilent, but the deſire of our heart muſt have a vent by prayer, as the Prophet had experience in himſelfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. So that as well the feare of danger to come, as preſent want and affliction, will leade us to prayer.</p>
                           <p>But when we are rid of all adverſity, yet there is another uſe of prayer, which is the <hi>Vſe of Duty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>We are to pray, not in regard of our ſelves, but in obedience to God, who commandeth prayer to be made by us, as a part of his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and duty, which we oweto him.</p>
                           <p>Prayer made of duty, is of two ſorts, both in regard of time and place.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Iob</hi> in the Law of nature tels us, that it is our duty: <hi>Invocare Deum omni tempore, Iob</hi> 27.10. and our Saviours charge unto his Diſciples is, that they ſhould <hi>ſemper orare, Luke</hi> 18. which the Apoſtle interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth by <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. But this cannot be performed of us, by reaſon of our infirmity, therefore we muſt expound this otherwiſe, and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes, we muſt ſpeake after the manner of men, <hi>propter infirmitatem, Rom.</hi> 6. and ſo we are commanded <hi>to pray alwaies;</hi> the meaning is, that it is our duty to appoint certaine houres for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Semper orat, qui per certa intervalla temporum orat,</hi> the reaſon of this expoſition is, for that our ſervice to God, muſt be <hi>a reaſonable ſervice, Rom.</hi> 12. and the preaching of the word muſt not be done negligently; for it muſt be <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. which cannot continually be performed of man without ſome reſpect.</p>
                           <p>Touching the ſet times appointed to the ſervice of God in the Law, it is appointed and required, that there ſhould be both mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and evening ſacrifice day by day, and that upon the Sabbath there ſhould be <hi>twice ſo long ſervice as upon other dayes, Numb.</hi> 2.8.</p>
                           <p>This publike ſervice was performed by the Jewes, among whom <hi>the booke of the Law was read foure times a day, Nehem.</hi> 9.3.</p>
                           <p>For private devotion the Prophet ſaith, <hi>In the evening, in the morning, and at noone day, will I call upon thee, Pſal.</hi> 55. and <hi>Daniel</hi> was <hi>for pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing three times a day, caſt into the Lions Denne, Dan.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>In the new Teſtament this duty of prayer was by the practiſe of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> limited to the <hi>third houre, Act.</hi> 2.15. to the <hi>ſixth houre, Acts</hi> 10.9. to the <hi>ninth houre,</hi> at which time <hi>Peter and Iohn went up to the Temple together to pray, Acts</hi> 3. whoſe diligence and care ought to ſtir us up to the like.</p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48000:313"/>
                           <p>Further the Diſciples deſire to be taught a right forme of prayer: not onely as here, as a Chriſtian, but as an Apoſtle and Miniſter ſent forth to preach the Goſpel: whereby we learne that prayer belongeth not onely in generall to every Chriſtian, but more particularly and ſpecially to thoſe that have any Eccleſiaſticall authority over others.</p>
                           <p>So that is an opinion very erronious, that we have no other uſe of the Apoſtles of Chriſt, and their Succeſſours, but onely for prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching: whereas, as it is a thing no leſſe hard to pray well, then to preach well: ſo the people reape as great benefit by the interceſſion of their Paſtors, which they continually make to God, both privately and publikely, as they doe by their preaching.</p>
                           <p>It is the part of the Miniſters of God, and thoſe that have the charge of the ſoules of others, not onely to inſtruct the flock, but to pray for them.</p>
                           <p>The office of <hi>Levi</hi> and his poſterity, as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſheweth, was not onely to teach the people the Lawes and Judgements of the Lord, and to inſtruct <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Law, but alſo <hi>to offer Incenſe unto the Lord, Deut.</hi> 33. Which <hi>Incenſe</hi> was nothing elſe but a <hi>type of prayer,</hi> made by the faithfull. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.</p>
                           <p>Therefore <hi>Samuel</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>that he ſhould ſinne no leſſe in ceaſing to pray for the people, then if he were ſlacke to ſhew them the good and right way,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23.</p>
                           <p>This duty the Miniſters of God may learne from the example of Chriſts owne practiſe, who <hi>went out early in the morning to pray, Marke</hi> 1.35. So he prayed for <hi>Peter, that his faith ſhould not faile, Luke</hi> 22. alſo from the example of the Apoſtles, who albeit they did put from them the miniſtration of the Sacraments, yet gave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves continually to <hi>prayer,</hi> and the <hi>Miniſtery of the word, Acts</hi> 6.4.</p>
                           <p>In which regard <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was ſent not to <hi>baptize, but to preach the Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17. which they did refuſe to doe, not as a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent to their office, but that they might with more attention of minde and fervencie of Spirit apply themſelves to make interceſſion for Gods people.</p>
                           <p>Thus much they are to learne from hence, that the Prieſts are <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geli Domini exercituum, Mal.</hi> 2.7. If Angels, then they muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſcend to the people to teach them the will of God, but aſcend to the preſence of God to make interceſſion for the people; and this they doe more cheerefully, for that God is more reſpective to the prayers which they make for the people, then the people are heedfull to the Law of God taught by them.</p>
                           <p>For this cauſe the Prieſts are called <hi>the Lords remembrancers, Eſa.</hi> 62.6. becauſe they put God in minde of his people, deſiring him continually to helpe and bleſſe them with things needfull; for God hath a greater reſpect to the prayers of thoſe that have a ſpirituall charge, then to thoſe that are of the common ſort. Thus the Lord would have <hi>Abimelech</hi> deale well with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and deliver him his wife, becauſe he <hi>is a Prophet,</hi> and <hi>ſhould pray for him that he may live, Gen.</hi> 20.</p>
                           <p>So to the friends of <hi>Iob</hi> the Lord ſaid: <hi>My ſervant</hi> Job <hi>ſhall
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48000:313"/>pray for you, and I will accept him, Iob.</hi> 42.</p>
                           <p>This office was appointed to the Prieſts in the Law, <hi>Levit.</hi> 5.6. <hi>orabit pro iis ſacerdos:</hi> Thus <hi>Ezechia</hi> ſent for <hi>Eſay:</hi> ſo ſaies he, <hi>Lift thou up thy prayer, Eſa.</hi> 37.4.</p>
                           <p>Men, as they are Chriſtians, ought to pray <hi>three times a day,</hi> as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 55. but as they are Prophets, and have a ſpeciall charge, they muſt pray to God <hi>ſeven times a day,</hi> as the ſame <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>This day of prayer, made by the Prieſts in the behalfe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was ſo highly eſteemed, that they tooke order that prayer ſhould be made continually: and becauſe the ſame Prieſts are not to doe all one thing, but to pray; therefore ſome were appointed for the firſt watches, others for the ſecond, and others for the third watches, that ſo while one reſted, the other might pray, whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpeaketh, when he ſaith, <hi>Mine eyes prevent the night watches, Pſal.</hi> 119. So Chriſt ſpeaketh of the <hi>firſt and ſecond watches, Luke</hi> 22.</p>
                           <p>Touching <hi>Davids</hi> diligence in performing of this duty for the good of the people, he ſaith, <hi>At midnight I will riſe up, to give <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>hankes to thee, Pſal.</hi> 119. So did <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, riſe at midnight to ſing praiſe to God, Acts</hi> 16. And it were to be wiſhed that the like order were taken in the Church, that the ſacrifice of prayer were continually offered among Chriſtians, as it was in the Synagogues of the <hi>Iewes.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, in regard of the place, we are every where to <hi>lift up pure hands,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and ſo the Pſalmiſt extendeth this part of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to all places generally of his Dominion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103. Howbeit though it be not to be neglected in no place; yet eſpecially wee muſt offer this ſacrifice of prayer and prayſe, <hi>in the aſſembly, among the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full in the congregation, Pſal.</hi> 111. and ſo we muſt learne to diſtinguiſh the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and the publike ſervice of God in the Church, from that <hi>private devotion,</hi> which our Saviour would have us to performe daily; when he ſaith, <hi>when thou prayeſt, enter into thy chamber, Matth.</hi> 6. For God hath promiſed to accept that worſhip which we tender unto him in the place conſecrate for that purpoſe: <hi>In every place where I put my name, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>ther will I come and bleſſe thee; Exod.</hi> 20.24. <hi>Non ſolum quod cratis, ſed quod ibi oratis,</hi> that is, the publike place whither the Saints of God from time to time aſſemble themſelves to call upon God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. In his <hi>Temple</hi> doth every man <hi>ſpeake of his praiſe, Pſal.</hi> 29. Our Saviour Chriſt did therefore tell them that it was <hi>domus orationis, Iſa.</hi> 56. to teach us, that the chiefe end of our meeting there ſhould be, not to make it a pub like ſchoole of Divinity, and inſtruction, but to powre out our prayers to God; for private prayers were not enough, unleſſe at times appointed we meete together to pray publikely.</p>
                           <p>So the Apoſtle Saint <hi>Peter</hi> doth teach us by his example, who not onely when he was at home went up <hi>to the top of his houſe to pray, Acts</hi> 10. but <hi>to the Temple alſo, Acts</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> did not content himſelfe to bow his knees to God when he was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and other places; but he went to <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and prayed <hi>in the Temple, Acts</hi> 22.11. which thing as he did for himſelfe; ſo no doubt, he did it in the behalfe of the Church of God,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48000:314"/>to which he was ſent to preach; and it were to be wiſhed that in the Church there were <hi>minus oratorum, &amp; plus orantium.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The ſecond generall point is, touching the contents of the word, <hi>Oratis.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Our neceſſities are manifold, and the grace of God, which we ſue for to God, is, <hi>multiformis gratia,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. Beſides, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Pray with all manner of prayer, Epheſ.</hi> 6. therefore it is meete that wee ſhould take notice how many kinds of prayer there are, wherein the Apoſtle guides us, when he ſaith, <hi>Let ſupplications, prayers, thankſ-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and interceſſions be made,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. Theſe foure containe all thoſe ſorts of prayer, which are contained in the body of this word, <hi>Orate.</hi>

                           <p>Prayer, or Invocation, conſiſts of Confeſſion and Petition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is divided into <hi>confeſsionem fraudis,</hi> which the Greekes call <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>The other kinde of Confeſſion is, <hi>Confeſsio laudis,</hi> that is, Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God for his goodneſſe in pardoning our ſinnes, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his benefits upon us, which kinde of Confeſſion is called <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>The one they call <hi>Tehillah,</hi> the other <hi>Tephillah.</hi>

                              <hi>Deprecation</hi> is, when we deſire that evill may be removed, which kinde of prayer is <gap reason="foreign">

                              <hi>Comprecation</hi> is, when we would have our want ſupplyed with good things, which is <gap reason="foreign">

                              <hi>Interceſsion,</hi> is in another kinde of prayer proceeding from charity, as the other came from faith, when we doe not onely confeſſe our owne ſinnes, but the ſinnes of others, when we pray not onely for our ſelves, but for others; when we praiſe God not onely for his goodneſſe on our ſelves, but for others.</p>
                           <p>So it was the charge which God gave by his Prophet to them in captivity, not onely to pray for themſelves, but <hi>to pray for the proſperity of the City where they were priſoners, Ier.</hi> 29.7.</p>
                           <p>As they were to have a care of the Common wealth, ſo the like is to be had of the Church. Therefore when <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, there was prayer made continually of the Church to God for him, <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                                    <desc>•••</desc>

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48000:314"/>no leſſe then for himſelfe, but <hi>put on ſack-cloth, and humbled his ſoule with fasting, Pſal.</hi> 35.</p>
                           <p>Unto theſe kindes of prayer, ſome adde two more; the firſt is, when upon condition that God will grant us our deſire, wee vow that we will faithfully ſerve him afterwards, as <hi>Iacob</hi> prayed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28. The other is a ſimple prayer or petition uttered in ſhort words, as, Lord have mercie on me, and ſuch like, which are nothing elſe, but ſparkes of that fire, which kindleth within us, whereof <hi>David</hi> ſpake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. <hi>Heare me Lord, and that right ſoone, for my ſpirit faileth,</hi> 143.</p>
                           <p>In regard of this our weakneſſe, our Saviour hath in a ſhort prayer comprehended whatſoever is needfull for us, which brevity hee uſed, leſt if he had ſet a large forme of prayer, our ſpirit ſhould bee dead, and our devotion key-cold before we could come to the end; and for the ſame purpoſe the Church hath preſcribed <hi>collects,</hi> prayers anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to that ſhort petition of our Saviour Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>All theſe kindes of prayers were uſed by our Saviour Chriſt in the dayes of his fleſh, as he tooke our nature, and was the head of a body, <hi>Factus pro nobis peccatum,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. and ſo did not onely confeſſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a ſinner, but ſuffered the wrath of God for it; which made him cry, <hi>Deus mi, Deus mi, My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Mat.</hi> 26. <hi>The rebuke of them that rebuked thee, fell on me, Rom.</hi> 15. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.</p>
                           <p>Alſo he was an example to us of thankſgiving, <hi>I thanke thee O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp;c. Luke.</hi> 10.21. <hi>I thanke thee that thou haſt heard me, Iohn</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>For <hi>Deprecation,</hi> as he was a man. <hi>Let this Cup paſſe from me, Matth.</hi> 26.</p>
                           <p>The good he prayed for at the hands of his Father, was, <hi>Pater glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificame ea gloria, quam habui apud te, &amp;c. Iohn</hi> 17.</p>
                           <p>Touching <hi>Interceſsion,</hi> he prayeth, <hi>Pater ignoſce eis, Luke</hi> 23. <hi>I pray not for them onely, but for all them that ſhall beleeve by their preaching, Iohn</hi> 17.</p>
                           <p>As he uſed all theſe kindes of prayer, ſo he ſet them all downe in this forme of prayer.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Confeſsion</hi> of ſinne, and the ſupplication for remiſsion, is in the five petitions; The <hi>thankſgiving</hi> is that <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>for thine is the Kingdome, power, and glory;</hi> and the good which he deſireth is, the ſanctification of Gods name, the accompliſhment of his Kingdome, and fulfilling of his will, as alſo a continuall ſupply of all things need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for this preſent life.</p>
                           <p>The evill from which he prayes to be delivered, is firſt, from ſinne it ſelfe: ſecondly, from the temptations of ſinne: thirdly, from evils, which are the effects of ſinne.</p>
                           <p>The third and laſt point in this Text is, that we obſerve ſomething in this word <hi>Dicite;</hi> whereof the firſt is, that here Chriſt doth not ſay, <hi>Say thus,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. whereof ſome gather, that we may frame prayers after the forme of the Lords prayer, but not uſe the words themſelves: But he ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Dicite, Pater noſter, &amp;c.</hi> that is, wee may boldly uſe the very words of this prayer; and albeit; to ſet forth the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of our hearts, we uſe other formes of prayer, and that in more words, yet we muſt conclude our prayers with this prayer of Chriſt.</p>
                           <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48000:315"/>
                           <p>Secondly, when he ſayes <hi>Dicite,</hi> he doth not ſay <hi>cogitate,</hi> or <hi>recita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te,</hi> or <hi>murmurate,</hi> but <hi>intus dicite &amp; cum ore,</hi> for there is a mouth in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>&amp; non eſt oratio ſine ore,</hi> therefore he alloweth vocall prayer; and as he will have us expreſſe the deſire of our hearts in words, ſo the chiefe thing is, that our prayers be from the heart; for <hi>invocation is a ſpirituall ſacrifice,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>A reaſonable ſervice, Rom.</hi> 12. So both the underſtanding and reaſon muſt be occupied, and alſo the ſpirit or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection of the heart: Our Saviour requireth both in expreſſe words, <hi>Worſhip him in ſpirit and in truth, Iohn</hi> 4. <hi>Sing with understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, Pſal.</hi> 47. <hi>I will pray with the ſpirit, and I will pray with the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.</p>
                           <p>We muſt not onely have a ſpirituall ſervencie and zeale, but alſo muſt know what we pray for, which is belonging to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding: So that if both doe not concurre, our ſervice is not reaſonable, nor our ſacrifice of praiſe, ſpirituall.</p>
                           <p>As for that prayer that comes onely from the lippes, it may be ſaid of it, as God ſpake of hypocrites, <hi>Is that the Faſt that I required? Iſa.</hi> 58. So, aſſembling to heare the word, as a people uſeth to doe, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33. <hi>Is that this which God requireth? Is this to eate the Lords Supper?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>It is not enough to make long prayers, and uſe many words, there is a ſpirituall prayer which God will have with our vocall petitions, and therefore, that we may pray with underſtanding, we have neede to be inſtructed in the ſenſe of the Lords prayer.</p>
                           <p>The excellencie of this prayer is in regard of him that made it, who is come from above, who hath mixed nothing with this petition that ſavoureth of the earth; for they are all heavenly, as hee himſelfe is heavenly. Secondly, in reſpect of the forme, which is a moſt perfect forme, it was compiled by him who was the <hi>wiſedome of God,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot be but perfect, <hi>quia perfecta ſunt opera Iehovae, Deut.</hi> 33. Thirdly, in regard of the excellent benefits that are procured to us by it, which are ſo many as can be deſired at the hands of God. Fourthly, for the order which Chriſt keepeth.</p>
                           <p>If man did make a prayer, he would beginne at daily bread: but Chriſt in this prayer teacheth us firſt to ſeeke <hi>the Kingdome of God, Matth.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>Our firſt petition muſt be for the glory of God, and then for our owne welfare, chiefly in the world to come; and alſo in this life: for as we may not pray at all for things that are evill, ſo in things that are good and lawfull, we muſt take heed that we aske not amiſſe.</p>
                           <p>The petitions being ſeven, are divided thus: The firſt, concerne God himſelfe, the other ſixe concerne us.</p>
                           <p>They concerne us in a three-fold eſtate, firſt, of Glory: ſecondly of Grace: thirdly, of Nature.</p>
                           <p>In theſe petitions that concerne us, the evill that we would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from us, is: firſt, ſin: ſecondly, temptation: thirdly, evill.</p>
                           <p>The good we deſire to be granted us, is, firſt, that Gods Kingdome may be in our hearts: ſecondly, that his will may be performed of us: thirdly, that he will give us things neceſſary for this preſent life.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His Prayer, penned by our Saviour Chriſt in the behalfe of his Diſciples and his Church unto the end of the world, ſtandeth firſt upon an <hi>Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> then upon certaine <hi>Petitions.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The invocation is the ſtile or word of ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein we call upon the Majeſty of God. The Petitions containe the ſum of thoſe things we ſeeke for at the hands of God.</p>
                           <p>That which we have generally to note out of this Preface is, that this is one benefit which God vouchſafeth us, that we may pray unto him and be heard; whereby we are to conceive of him that hee is not like the great Monarches, to whom no man might preſume to ſpeak, except <hi>he hold out his golden Scepter to him,</hi> as it is in <hi>Est.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The heavenly Majeſty vouchſafeth every man this honour to ſpeak to him, and the Golden Scepter of his word doth allure us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it is a greater benefit to pray to God on this manner, that is by the name of Father; and therefore by that which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth the faithfull, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. <hi>Before they call I will heare them,</hi> wee are taught that we are ſo aſſured of Gods good will and favour towards us, even before we open our mouthes to aske any thing of him, that we doubt not to call him <hi>Father;</hi> from whence we may reaſon as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>Seeing he hath given us his Sonne, how ſhall he not with him give us all things?</hi> So ſeeing God taketh us for his children, how ſhall he deny us any thing, whereby he may ſhew himſelfe a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the firſt we conſider the <hi>perfection</hi> of Gods goodneſſe, in theſe words, <hi>Our Father:</hi> In the ſecond, the <hi>excellencie</hi> of his power, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thus: <hi>Which art in Heaven.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Both theſe are attributed unto God, not onely of the Chriſtians, but even by the Heathen, that are ſtrangers to the Church; for they attribute this unto God, that he is <hi>optimus, maximus,</hi> and therefore
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48000:316"/>where theſe two doubts ariſe in our hearts, <hi>Domine ſi vis,</hi> Lord, <hi>if thou wilt, Matth.</hi> 8. and <hi>Domine ſi quid potes, Marke</hi> 9. they are both ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by theſe two attributes.</p>
                           <p>By that terme which ſetteth out the <hi>perfection</hi> of Gods goodneſſe, he aſſureth us that he is willing, and by that which expreſſeth the <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie</hi> of his power, we are taught that he is able to performe our requeſts.</p>
                           <p>His goodneſſe giveth us <hi>fiduciam,</hi> that in regard of it we may <hi>boldly come to the throne of grace, Heb.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The conſideration of Gods power breedeth in us <hi>devotion</hi> and <hi>reverence,</hi> (for both muſt be joyned together) neither feare with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſideration of his goodneſſe, nor bold confidence that is not tempered with a dutifull regard of his power, is acceptable to him.</p>
                           <p>So that which we learned <hi>in lege credendi,</hi> that God is the Father Almighty, is here taught againe <hi>in lege ſupplicandi;</hi> where wee are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in our prayers to aſcribe both theſe unto God: firſt, that hee is our <hi>Father;</hi> ſecondly, our <hi>heavenly Father.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The conſideration of theſe two, are the pillars of our faith, and there is no petition wherein we doe not deſire, that God will either ſhew us his goodneſſe, or aſſiſt us with his power, and no Pſalme or Hymne, that is not occupied in ſetting forth one of theſe.</p>
                           <p>The titles which expreſſe Gods goodneſſe have two words, the one a word of faith, the other a word of hope and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
                           <p>Of both theſe words of <hi>Pater,</hi> and <hi>noster, Baſil</hi> ſaith, that here <hi>Lex ſupplicandi, non modo credendi, ſed operandi Legem ſtatuit, The Law of prayer, doth not onely eſtabliſh and confirme the Law of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe, but of working alſo,</hi> For where in the word <hi>Father,</hi> is expreſſed the love of God to us, it comprehendeth withall the love wee beare to him.</p>
                           <p>Where we call God <hi>our Father,</hi> and not <hi>my Father,</hi> therein is contained our love to our neighbour, whom we are to love no leſſe then our ſelves, <hi>Vpon theſe two hang the Law and the Prophets. Matth.</hi> 22.</p>
                           <p>Againe, the word <hi>Father,</hi> is a word of faith, and <hi>our,</hi> a word of charity; and the thing required of us in the new Teſtament is, <hi>Fides per charitatem operans, Faith, which worketh by charity, Gal.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>So that in theſe words <hi>Our Father,</hi> we have a ſumme both of the Law and the Goſpel.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt might have deviſed many more magnificent and excellent termes for God; but none were apt and fit for us to aſſure us of Gods favour. Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. <hi>That earthly fathers which many times are evill men, have notwithſtanding this care for their children, that if they aske them bread, they will not give them a ſtone: much more ſhall our heavenly Father give us the holy Spirit, if we aske it.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherefore Chriſt teaching us to call God by the name of <hi>Father,</hi> hath made choyce of that word, which might ſerve moſt to ſtirre us
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48000:316"/>up unto hope, for it is <hi>Magnum nomen ſub quo nemini deſperandum,</hi> a great name under which no man can deſpaire.</p>
                           <p>There may ſeeme an oppoſition to be betwixt theſe words, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> and <hi>Our,</hi> if we conſider, firſt, the Majeſty of God, before whom the hils doe tremble, and the Angels in Heaven cover their faces; Secondly, our owne uncleanneſſe and baſeneſſe, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the mould whereof we be made, which made <hi>Abraham</hi> confeſſe himſelfe unworthy <hi>to ſpeake unto God, being but duſt and aſhes, Gen.</hi> 18. And alſo in regard of our pollution of ſinne, in which regard we are called, <hi>The ſlaves of ſinne, and children of the Devill, Iohn</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>Herein we finde a great diſtance between God and us, and ſo are we farre from challenging this honour to bee the ſonnes of God in regard of our ſelves. <hi>Who durſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Cyprian</hi>) <hi>pray to God by the name of Father, if Chriſt our Advocate did not put theſe words in our mouthes?</hi> He knoweth how God ſtandeth affected towards us, for all our unworthineſſe; and therefore ſeeing he hath framed this patition for us, we may boldly as he commandeth, ſay thus, <hi>Our Fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                           <p>Therefore albeit of our ſelves we cannot conceive hope, that God is our <hi>Father,</hi> yet we may call him <hi>Father</hi> by the authority of Chriſt, and ſay with <hi>Auguſtine, Agnoſce Domine ſtilum advocati Fil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ui, Lord take notice of the ſtile of our Advocate, thy Sonne.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wee know not Gods affection towards us, but by Chriſt wee take notice of him, for hee hath <hi>declared him unto us, Iohn</hi> 1.18. and being taught that God in Chriſt vouchſafeth to admit us for his children, <hi>Wee doe with boldneſſe come to the throne of grace, Heb.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we have thankfully to conſider unto what dignity wee that live under the Goſpel are exalted, not onely above the Patriarches in the time of the Law, but above the heavenly Spirits.</p>
                           <p>Before the Law was given, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaith, <hi>Shall I ſpeake to the Lord? Gen.</hi> 18. In the Law Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Ego ſum Dominus Deus tuus, Exod.</hi> 20. then he was not called <hi>Father.</hi> But if we aske that queſtion which the Apoſtle makes, <hi>To which of the Angels ſaid he, Thou art my Sonne? Heb.</hi> 1.5. It will appeare that God hath honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us in a degree above Angels, for that he giveth us leave to call him <hi>Father.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee what preheminence we have from God, above, as well the Saints on earth in time of the Law, as the heavenly Angels; that we may not only pray, but pray thus, <hi>Our Father.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the word <hi>Father,</hi> we are further to note, not onely that God is the <hi>cauſe of all things,</hi> for that he bringeth forth all things, but alſo his <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, or <hi>naturall affection,</hi> to thoſe things that are produced.</p>
                           <p>Gods <hi>Paternity</hi> is firſt generally to be conſidered in all creatures, which for that they have their being from God, he is ſaid to be their <hi>Father,</hi> So <hi>Iob</hi> called God <hi>Pater pluviae, The Father of the raine, Iob</hi> 38. Alſo he is called <hi>Pater Luminum, Iam.</hi> 1.17. and this is a motive
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48000:317"/>ſufficient to move God to be favourable to our prayer, if there were no more, that we are his creatures: ſo <hi>David</hi> ſpake, <hi>Deſpiſe n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>t the work of thine owne hands, Pſal.</hi> 138. But men have another uſe of Gods <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> for whereas of other things God ſaid, <hi>Producat terra, Ger.</hi> 1. When man was to be created, he ſaid, <hi>Let us make man,</hi> giving us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that how ſoever other creatures had their being from God <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,</hi> God himſelfe would be his <hi>Father,</hi> and frame him <hi>immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately</hi> with his owne hand.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, when God created man according to his owne Image, he breathed into him life immortall, he gave him the ſparkes of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and indued his ſoule with reaſon and underſtanding, in which regard it is called the <hi>candle of the Lord, Prov.</hi> 21.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, when man was fallen from his firſt eſtate, God ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him a doore of repentance, which favour hee hath not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to the Angels that fell, and ſo wee may crave Gods favour, not onely as we are the workes of Gods hands, but as we are his owne Image.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, God is our <hi>Father,</hi> as we are Chriſtians: that which <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaith; <hi>Is he not thy Father? Deut.</hi> 33. and, <hi>Doubtleſſe thou art our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Iſa.</hi> 63. is to be underſtood of our generation; but we have a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond birth, called <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>And our dignity in being the ſonnes of God, in theſe three ſorts is to be conſidered:

                           <p>And indeed whether hee doe beſtow good things on us, or chaſten us, his love is ſtill <hi>unchangeable,</hi> for both are to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of a father toward his children, and therefore whether hee afflict us, or beſtow his bleſſings on us, we are in both to acknowledge his fatherly care, howſoever <hi>To fleſh and bloud no affliction ſeemeth good for the preſent, Heb.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>immutability</hi> of his love, as it miniſtreth comfort in time of affliction, ſo doth it comfort and raiſe us up in ſinne and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, ſo that notwithſtanding the greatneſſe of our ſinnes, wee may bee bold to ſeeke to God for favour, and ſay, <hi>Etſi amiſi inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuitatem filii, tamen tu non amiſiſti pietatem patris:</hi> Although Lord, I have loſt the duty of a ſonne, yet thou haſt not loſt the affection of a father.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>excellencie</hi> of Gods love appeareth herein, that he is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to be God under the name of a King, or great Lord, as <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. There we have an example of great goodneſſe in pardoning tenne thouſand Talents; but yet a doubt will ariſe in our mindes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we know him to be good otherwiſe then as he is a King: for ſo looke what mercie he ſheweth to us, the like he will have us ſhew to others, but we come ſhort of this. But this is it that contents us, that he deſcribes his goodneſſe under the terme of <hi>Father:</hi> in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard how wickedly ſoever we deale, yet ſtill wee may ſay with the evill child, <hi>I will goe to my Father, Luke</hi> 15. He had caſt off his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he had ſpent all his patrimony; yet for all that he reſolveth to goe backe, and his father is glad to receive him, he went, and met, and entertained him joyfully; ſuch affection doth God beare to his children.</p>
                           <p>The benefits that we have by the fatherly love of God is of two ſorts: Firſt, <hi>Fructus indulgentiae paternae:</hi> Secondly, <hi>Fructus liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis paternae:</hi> that is, the <hi>fruit of fatherly compaſsion,</hi> and <hi>the fruit of fatherly bounty.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fathers ſtand thus affected towards their children, that they are hardly brought to chaſten them, and if there be no remedy, yet they are ready to forgive, or ſoone ceaſe puniſhing: <hi>Pro peccato magno panlulum ſupplicii ſatis eſt Patri,</hi> for a great offence, a ſmall puniſhment is enough to a father.</p>

                           <p>The affection of <hi>David</hi> toward <hi>Abſolon,</hi> a wicked ſonne, was ſuch, that he forgave him, though he ſought <hi>to deprive his father of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. and though wee offend the Majeſty of God, yet hee aſſureth us, that hee will be no leſſe gracious to our offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then <hi>David</hi> was, For <hi>David was a man after Gods owne heart,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.</p>

                           <p>Touching the care which God hath to provide for us, the Prophet ſaith, and alſo the Apoſtle, <hi>Caſt your care upon the Lord, for hee careth for you,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. He careth for us, not as he hath care of <hi>Oxen,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. but ſuch a tender care as he hath for the <hi>Apple of his eye, Zach.</hi> 2.

                           <p>Out of theſe two, the <hi>immutability,</hi> and <hi>excellencie</hi> of Gods love, ſhewed both in forgiving ſinnes, and providing good things, ariſeth a duty to be performed on our parts, for <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>But the Apoſtle ſets down this plainely; Behold, what great love he hath ſhewed us, <hi>That we ſhould be called the ſonnes of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. This dignity requireth this duty at our hands, that we <hi>reverence our Father, Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>If I be your Father, where is my love? If yee call him Father, without reſpect of perſons, &amp;c.

                              <hi>Our,</hi> is a word of <hi>hope,</hi> as <hi>Father</hi> is a word of <hi>faith,</hi> for he that ſaies <hi>noſter, our,</hi> includes himſelfe, and by hope applyeth Gods favour in particular to himſelfe, which by faith he apprehends to be common to all, neither doth appropriate it to himſelfe, ſaying, <hi>My Father,</hi> but includes them with himſelfe; and ſo the word <hi>our</hi> is alſo <hi>Vox chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis,</hi> the voyce of Charity.</p>
                           <p>As the firſt word did teach us the Father-hood of God, ſo the word <hi>our,</hi> implyeth the fraternity we have one with another: for God, to ſhew what great regard he hath of the love of our neighbour, hath ſo framed and indited this prayer, that there is neither <hi>Ego,</hi> nor <hi>mi,</hi> nor <hi>meum,</hi> nor <hi>mea,</hi> neither <hi>I,</hi> nor <hi>mine,</hi> nor <hi>my,</hi> but ſtill the tenor of it is, <hi>Our Father, our bread, our treſpaſſes, us from evill.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Therefore one ſaith, that prayer is not onely, <hi>breviarium fidei,</hi> an abridgment of our faith, but <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, a mutuall pledge of our love towards our brethren, which is then eſpecially teſtified, when we pray to God for them: For this prayer which our Saviour ſets downe
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48000:318"/>for us, and all Chriſtians prayers; are not the prayers of nature, <hi>pro ſe orat neceſsitas,</hi> neceſſity ſtirreth up men to pray for themſelves: but the prayers of charity, when we are to commend the ſtate of our brethren to God as well as our owne, <hi>quia pro ali is charitas,</hi> for charity prayeth for others; for in this prayer there is matter not onely of <hi>ſupplication</hi> for the avoyding of evill, and <hi>comprecation</hi> for the obtaining of good in our owne behalfe; but of <hi>Interceſsion</hi> alſo, to teach us, that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we deſire that evill be rëmoved, or good be beſtowed upon us; we ſhould deſire it for others, as well as for our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>The uſe of this doctrine is of two ſorts: firſt, againſt <hi>Pride,</hi> for if God be not the Father of one man more then another, but all in common doe call him <hi>Our Father,</hi> why then doth one man exalt himſelfe above another? <hi>Have we not all one Father? Mal.</hi> 2. and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Yee are all the ſonnes of God, by faith in Chriſt Ieſus, Gal.</hi> 3. and our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Vos omnes fratres eſtis, Yee are all brethren, Mal.</hi> 2.3.8. Therefore we are not onely to love one another as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, but to honour one another, becauſe we are the ſonnes of God; for this end the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>In giving honour to one before an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. Rom.</hi> 12. So farre ought we to be from deſpiſing one another, <hi>Cur enim non pudeat aſpernari fratrem, quem Deus non aſpernatur fili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um?</hi> Why are we not aſhamed to ſcorne him to be our brother, whom God ſcorneth not to be his ſonne?</p>
                           <p>Secondly, it ſerveth againſt malice, we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e were all in the loynes of <hi>Adam</hi> when he fell, and all one in the body of Chriſt; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he, as our <hi>Head,</hi> hath done or ſuffered, the ſame all men doe, and ſuffer in him.</p>
                           <p>And laſtly, we are all included in this word, to teachus, that wee ought to wiſh the ſame good to others, which we doe to our ſelves, for this is that which Chriſt commendeth in our Chriſtian practiſe in the duty of prayer, <hi>Vt ſinguli orent pro omnibus, &amp; omnes pro ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulis,</hi> that each ſhould pray for all, and all for each other.</p>
                           <p>He hath taken order, that no man can pray this prayer, but he muſt pray for others, as well as for himſelfe, and ſo doe good to all, and the mends that is made him is, that they alſo for whom he prayed, doe likewiſe at another time pray for him; and though we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes pray in ſuch fervencie of Spirit as is required in prayer, yet the holy Ghoſt doth <hi>ſupply our infirmity,</hi> by ſtirring up others to pray, and make interceſſion in our behalfe, <hi>cum gemitibus inenarrabilibus, with unſpeakable groanes, Rom.</hi> 8. even then when we cannot doe for our ſelves; and this is a ſpeciall benefit, which the faithfull have in the Communion of Saints.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, that God, to aſſure us that hee takes us for his ſonnes, hath ſent his Spirit into our hearts, whereby we cry <hi>Abba Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Gal.</hi> 4. the one of theſe words hath reſpect to the <hi>Iewes,</hi> the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> teaching that it is our duty to pray both for <hi>Iewes</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and ſo for all though they be ſtrangers to us.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we are to pray for ſinners, be their ſinnes never ſo great, in hope that God will give them the <hi>Grace to repent, and to come out of the ſnare of the Devill,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. and that he will tranſlate them out of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48000:319"/>the ſtate of ſinne into the ſtate of grace, for this life as long as it laſteth is, <hi>tempus praeſtitutum poenitentiae,</hi> a time ordained for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, as for our <hi>brethren,</hi> ſo for our <hi>enemies,</hi> as our Saviour willeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.44. for they alſo are comprehended under the word <hi>noſter; For God hath ſhut up all in unbeliefe, that hee may have mercie upon all.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Neither are we to pray in generall for all, but for ſome in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as neede requireth.</p>
                           <p>Not in generall for all good things, but for ſome ſpeciall bleſſings.</p>
                           <p>As we are to pray generally, that Gods will may be done, ſo, for that this is Gods will, <hi>our ſanctification,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. we may pray in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular for thoſe things that we have neede, as to be delivered from all temptations generally, ſo ſpecially from thoſe ſinnes, whereunto the corruption of our nature is moſt inclined.</p>

                           <p>Chriſt willing to expreſſe the greatneſſe of Gods power, doth it by that place, where his glory and power are moſt manifeſt, and that is heaven, whereof the Prophet ſaith, <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament ſheweth his handy worke, Pſal.</hi> 19.1. For when we ſee a poore cottage, we preſently gheſſe, that the dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler is no great perſon; but if wee meete with ſome great houſe, we conjecture that ſome perſon of account dwells there, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the baſeneſſe of man, in reſpect of the Angels, is great, for that he dwels in the houſes of clay, whoſe foundation is of the duſt, Job</hi> 4.19. But here our Saviour tells us, that God our Father, hath his dwelling in the ſtately Tabernacle of <hi>Heaven;</hi> whereby we may gather what is the greatneſſe of his power.</p>
                           <p>But before we come to theſe things, which are particularly to be conſidered in theſe words: Firſt, we are to take heed that wee run not into their errour, which ſo confine and compaſſe God in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as if he had nothing to do in earth, ſuch as they, who ſay: <hi>How ſhould God know? can be judge through the darke cloud? the clouds cover
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48000:320"/>him that hee cannot ſee? Job.</hi> 22.14. For when he is ſaid to have <hi>his beeing in heaven,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt thereby doth not expreſſe his preſence, but his power, therefore we are to know, that God is not ſo in heaven, that he is not in earth alſo; for ſo doth the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment witneſſe of him, <hi>Coelum &amp; terram ego impleo, Jer.</hi> 23. <hi>Behold the heaven, and heavens, and the heaven of all heavens, are not able to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thee.</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.27. and the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>If I goe up to heaven, thou art there: if I go downe to hell, thou art there alſo, Pſal.</hi> 139. Whereby it appeareth that we may not limit Gods power and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to any one place, who is every where preſent, for when God is ſaid to be <hi>in heaven,</hi> we learne thereby what his excellencie is, which doth eſpecially ſhew it ſelfe there; for as the glory &amp; Majeſty of earthly Princes, doth chiefly appeare in their thrones; ſo the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Majeſty of God, doth eſpecially ſhew it ſelf in <hi>heaven,</hi> which is <hi>his Throne, Eſay</hi> 66. <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.34. He hath not his denomination from earth, a place of wormes and corruption, but from heaven, a place of eternall glory and happineſſe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the uſe of this is, to temper our confidence in God; for albeit we love him as he is our Father; yet withall we muſt feare him, for as much as he dwelleth in heaven; as we may in regard of his goodnes, pray unto him with confidence, ſo withall, conſidering his power, we muſt pray with due devotion and reverence unto his Majewy, for he is not as an earthly father, that dwelleth in houſes clay; but his dwelling is in heaven, and therefore as he is a Father, and conſequently will be honoured, ſo becauſe he is <hi>our Lord,</hi> he requires <hi>feare at our hands, Mal.</hi> 1.6. <hi>With thee is mercy that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt be feared, Pſal.</hi> 130.4. Whereby the Prophet would have us ſo to eſteeme of Gods mercy; that withall we be bound to feare him; and that we be not like thoſe that contemne the riches of Gods mercy, the more that he laboureth with his bountifulneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to bring us to repentance, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. for as ſweet things have an obſtructive power to ſtop the paſſages which are in our bodies, and on the other ſide ſowre and bitter things do fret and conſume, and ſo open the veines: So it fareth with the ſoule, for it is ſtopped when we conſider nothing but the mercy of God, and contrariwiſe, when we caſt our eyes too much upon the Majeſty and power of God, the force thereof caſts us into an aſtoniſhment, and brings to deſperation, and therefore, that we neither have <hi>Nimiam trepidatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> nor <hi>Nimiam oſtentationem,</hi> too much terrour, nor too much ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; we muſt know that God is <hi>ſo in heaven,</hi> as that yet he is a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and as he is a <hi>Father,</hi> ſo not an earthly, but an heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and we cannot but feare and reverence God, if we in humility conſider our baſeneſſe in reſpect of him, for though he be our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, yet ſo long as we be on earth, we are ſtrangers and exiles from him, and howſoever it pleaſe him to account us ſonnes; yet as it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Abſalon,</hi> we cannot ſee our Fathers face, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. untill he take us hence, that we may be at home with him in his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Glory.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, theſe words lead us alſo to a confidence in God, and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48000:320"/>ſerve to raiſe up our faith: There is <hi>Paternitas</hi> both in heaven and earth, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.16. There are <hi>Fathers of the fleſh, and Fathers of the ſpirit, Heb.</hi> 12. But when the Holy Ghoſt ſaith, that God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath his being <hi>in heaven,</hi> we are thereby to diſtinguiſh him from other fathers. If he be an heavenly Father, he is of a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent nature, then other fathers that are earthly and carnall, for they are mortall; as they live on earth, ſo by death they ſhall be brought <hi>ſub terris,</hi> and do forſake us, but our heavenly Father is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, his <hi>yeares change not, Pſal.</hi> 102. and <hi>though our Fathers, and mothers forſake us, yet the Lord will take us up and ſuccour us, Pſal.</hi> 27. Secondly, though earthly fathers were immortall, yet they are not able, and their affections are turned away, either by meanes of ſome lewd parts in the children, or for that they beare not that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall affection towards their children which they ought. But God is immutable in his love: ſo that although <hi>Jacob will not acknowledge us, and Abraham will not know us; yet God will be our Father, Eſay</hi> 63.16.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>There are wicked parents that are</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>without all naturall affection, Rom.</hi> 1. And it falleth out that ſometime a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man will deale cruelly with her owne child; but though <hi>ſhe forget it, yet God our heavenly Father, will not forget his children, nor turne his fatherly affection from them, Eſay</hi> 49. and therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith: <hi>Nullus pater tam pater:</hi> no father ſo fatherly. Thirdly, though they wiſh us never ſo well, yet many times they cannot do us that good they would, for want of ability, yea though they be never ſo able, yet they cannot deliver from ſickneſſe and death, for <hi>the ſonnes of Princes die daily,</hi> they can give us <hi>bread and fiſh, Luk.</hi> 11. they have <hi>a care to provide and lay up for their children,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.14. but it is ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as the <hi>moth and ruſt will corrupt, Matth.</hi> 6.19. But God our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father can deliver us from all evill, he can give us, not onely <hi>bread and fiſh, and other things neceſſary for this life, but his holy Spirit if wee aske it, Luk.</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>The treaſure that God layeth up for us, is not earthly, but <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance incorruptible, and undefiled,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. ſuch things <hi>as neither eie hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, Eſay</hi> 64. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. For God is not onely carefull in this life for our well doing; the knowledge of that is <hi>ſpes mortua:</hi> but his care extendeth to the life to come, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Holy Ghoſt ſaith not <hi>Pater in coelo, ſed in coelis, in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, whereby he hath begotten us unto a lively hope,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque optant vel timent homines,</hi> Whatſoever things men either with for, or are affrayd of, all things come from heaven, whether it be raine, drought, or contagion, or plague, and from the firſt heaven, <hi>Ubi vultures coeli, Matth.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>From this heaven Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels the heathen that God ſends us <hi>raine, and fruitfull ſeaſons, Act.</hi> 14. And when <hi>Job</hi> ſaith that God ſends <hi>raine, and froſts, and ſnow; and thundreth, and worketh marvellous things, &amp;c. Job</hi> 37. that is done in <hi>Primo coelo.</hi> But in the ſecond heaven are the Eclipſes of the Sunne and Moone, there he workes in the ſignes of heaven, <hi>He binds the ſeven ſtarres together, Job</hi> 38.31. whatſoever wonders are wrought there, it is God that worketh
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48000:321"/>them, and therefore he ſaith to his ſonnes, <hi>Nolite timere à ſignis coeli. Jer.</hi> 10. he is in the ſecond heaven, and will not ſuffer any thing to hurt them.</p>
                           <p>The third heaven is that whereunto the Saints of God ſhall be received in the life to come, where Saint <hi>Paul heard things that were not lawfull to be uttered,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. So that as God will not ſuffer the firſt or ſecond heaven to do us hurt, ſo hee will bring us to the happineſſe of the third heaven: for he is <hi>Pater noſter in coelis:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have hope and comfort not in this life onely, which is but a dead hope, but a lively hope touching the life to come. For Chriſt doth not expreſſe Gods power by an action, ſaying, <hi>Our Father which madeſt heaven and earth, Pſal.</hi> 121. nor, <hi>which rideſt upon the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, Pſal.</hi> 68. But by a locall word, to ſhew, that as God is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, ſo we have an intereſt in the ſame place, and that he will at the length bring us to the ſame place where he is.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, this word <hi>Heaven</hi> ſerveth to prepare us to prayer, to the end that we ſhould lift up our hearts and affections, from earth to heaven, ſeeing we ſpeake not to an earthly father, but to one that is in heaven, and this is that <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>As the conſideration of Gods Majeſty, who is in heaven, doth bring us downe and make us <hi>bow our knees before God our Father. Eph.</hi> 3. So it muſt cauſe us <hi>levare manus &amp; corda, Lam.</hi> 3. and <hi>to lift up our eyes to the hills, Pſal.</hi> 121. and to have ſuch a continuall medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his power, that we may ſay with <hi>David, Providebam Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in conſpeclu meo ſemper, I have ſet the Lord alwayes before mee.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, this word doth admoniſh us, what things we ſhould ſue unto God for, he is a heavenly Father, therefore we muſt aske of him heavenly things; his anſwer to the ſons of <hi>Zebedeus</hi> was, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>Ye aske yee know not what,</hi> honour and wealth are not things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to him that is in heaven, and an earthly Prince will count it a diſgrace, if a man aske at his hands meane things, ſuch as may be had of every man.</p>
                           <p>The gifts we are to aske of our heavenly Father, are the eternall ſalvation of our ſoules, this gift of the holy Ghoſt, which he hath promiſed to them that <hi>aske it, Luk.</hi> 11. and <hi>all ſpirituall bleſsings in heavenly places, Eph.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                           <p>God is a Father, as <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and as he had <hi>moveable goods,</hi> which he gave to the ſonnes of <hi>Keturah;</hi> ſo he beſtowed the <hi>inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi> which was <hi>immoveable,</hi> upon his ſonne <hi>Iſaas, Gen.</hi> 25. So we

                           <p>Unto <hi>Martha</hi> that was troubled about many things, our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Unum eſt neceſſarium, Luk.</hi> 10. and this is the reaſon why it is not ſaid, <hi>qui es in terris;</hi> For God ſheweth himſelfe a Father, rather in heaven then in earth, <hi>Deus pater eſt in coelis,</hi> he is in heaven by aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us of Gods heavenly bleſſings: for they are the ſignes of Gods fatherly bounty to ſuch as are his heires by promiſe; as for earthly things he ſheweth himſelfe in them rather to the ſonnes of <hi>Keturah</hi> then to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and in reſpect of this world, <hi>Martha</hi> is ſaid <hi>to have choſen the better part, Luk.</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, as it teacheth us, what we muſt pray for, ſo alſo we learn hereby what wee are to judge of our ſelves, and how we are to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of our minds, when we come to pray; if God our Father be in heaven, then becauſe we are yet on earth, we muſt eſteeme of our ſelves as ſtrangers and pilgrims. This did all the Fathers acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, <hi>I am a ſtranger, and ſojourner upon earth, as all my Fathers were, Pſal.</hi> 39. and therefore having a longing to be in our City, <hi>Wo is mee that I am conſtrained to dwell in Meſhech, Pſal.</hi> 120. The Apoſtles <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> confeſſed the ſame, the one writing to the Church of God calleth them <hi>Pilgrims and ſtrangers,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. the others repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of the Fathers that they confeſſed themſelves <hi>ſtrangers</hi> and <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims</hi> upon earth; and in ſaying theſe things they ſhew that they ſought a country, not the land of <hi>Canaan</hi> from whence they came, for they had time to returne thither if they had beene mindfull of it; but they ſought a better, that is, an <hi>Heavenly City, Heb.</hi> 11.13. and <hi>we have no abiding City here, but do looke for one to come, Heb.</hi> 12.13.</p>
                           <p>Theſe ſhew us that albeit we have our dwelling in earth, and be ſubject to many calamities, yet for this our exile, we do, <hi>genus de coelo ducere,</hi> we take our pedegree from heaven: When therefore as the Poet ſaith, <hi>os homini ſublime dedit;</hi> it is a ſhame for us to have our hearts downeward; we muſt remember that we are of a more excellent nature then other creatures, <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>During this our exile and pilgrimage, we are not onely to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that we looke upwards with our faces, (which moved the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to meditate on heaven) but chiefly, that in our ſoules wee have the Image of God imprinted, ought to move the people to thinke of God, and <hi>to ſet our minds onthings above, Col.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Albeit we be here in a farre country farre from our fathers dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; yet we muſt not forget our fathers <hi>dwelling houſe, Luk.</hi> 15.</p>

                           <p>The poition is in heaven which our Father will give us, and that we ſeeke to be acquainted with the lawes of that country, where our inheritance lyeth, that we may guide our lives according to the ſame, leſt being rebellious, we deprive ourſelves of our right and be diſinherited.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, ſeeing we know that we are not in our owne country, we muſt ſay as <hi>Abſolon</hi> did: <hi>Why am I come hither, if I may not ſee the Kings face?</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14. He being an ungratious ſonne, was deſirous to ſee his father: then it ſhall be a ſhame for us, that are all the <hi>Sons of God, by faith in Chriſt Jeſus, Gal.</hi> 3. if we have not a longing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to come <hi>before the preſence of God our Father, Pſal.</hi> 42. and except we have a deſire to <hi>enter into the Courts of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 84. except that with the Apoſtle, we <hi>deſire to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 1. the firſt begotten of many brethren; and if with our Father God, we lay up our treaſure in heaven, and count it our chiefe felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to be there, then would we thinke upon heaven more then we doe: For, <hi>where our treaſure is, there muſt our hearts be alſo, Matth.</hi> 6. But becauſe we altogether ſet our hearts on earthly things, therefore it falls out that our heart is as a heavy clodde of earth, and unable to lift it ſelfe up to heavenly meditation.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, as wee deſire to be in heaven in our Fathers houſe: ſo our converſation muſt be <gap reason="foreign">

                           <p>Chriſt, who is the Lord from heaven, did ſubject himſelfe to the will of God his Father; <hi>Not my will, but thy will be done:</hi> and as <hi>hee that is heavenly,</hi> ſo muſt <hi>they that will be heavenly:</hi> as we now <hi>beare the Image of the earthly,</hi> ſo ſhall we <hi>port are imaginem cooleſtis,</hi> 1 <hi>Col.</hi> 15.</p>
                           <p>He while he lived on earth, did guide himſelfe by an heavenly law, and we that remaine on earth muſt expreſſe his image by the imitation of his obedience.

But there muſt be an imitation, and we muſt ſet our ſelves forward towards our heavenly country. But becauſe it is not in our power to doe this of our ſelves: for that, as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>No man can come to mee, except the Father draw him, Joh.</hi> 6. therefore wee muſt pray with the Church in the <hi>Canticles, Cant.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Trabe me,</hi> and to this end doth the holy exerciſe of faſting and mortification ſerve great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wee may, as it were, with <hi>Doves</hi> wings, flye up into Heaven.</p>

                           <p>As the word <hi>Father</hi> doth ſhew us not onely our dignity, but our duty alſo; ſo the word <hi>Heavenly,</hi> doth not onely give us a hope of heaven, but alſo teacheth us, that ſeeing our Father is heavenly, wee muſt live by the lawes of Heaven. As we are carefull to be made partakers of the inheritance which God hath prepared for us; ſo we muſt be as carefull to pleaſe him, and to do thoſe things which are agreeable to his will.

                              <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving ended the firſt part of this prayer, which we called <hi>Invocation,</hi> conſiſting upon the power and goodneſſe of God, we come to the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons themſelves, which are ſeven, of which the firſt concerneth God, the other concerne our ſelves: or they may be divided as the dayes of the weeke, whereof, as one falleth out to Gods portion, the other to be imployed in our owne affaires. So, of theſe petitions, the firſt doth immediately concerne the glory of God, the other ſixe the ſupply of our owne neceſſities: in the beginning we heard that it is expedient to know not onely what we are to aske, but in what order; what firſt, and what ſecond; touching which point we are taught by this forme of prayer, that that petition which concerneth the ſanctification of Gods name, is <hi>Caput votorum;</hi> and that all other things that we either deſire, or pray for in our owne behalfe, ought to ſtand after it: and that wee muſt both deſire and pray for the ſanctification of Gods name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any thing that we deſire, either for our ſelves, or for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; whether it be for the removing of evill, or for the obtaining of good: for as before we learned what his love is to us, in that he vouchſafed to be our Father; ſo hereby we ſhall expreſſe our love againe to him, if when we come to pray to him for our neceſſities, we be carried away with ſuch a deſire of the glory of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, that we forget our owne ſelves, and deſire onely that his name may be ſanctified, which duty Chriſt doth by his owne exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple commend unto us.</p>
                           <p>In this forme of prayer, we are put in mind of that which before was required in the law of works; for as there vve learned, that God is not honoured aright, except he be loved above all things, becauſe he created all things: and <hi>for his wills ſake they all were created, Rev.</hi> 4.11. So we cannot pray to him aright, except above all things, and in the firſt place we ſeeke for the ſanctification of his Name.</p>
                           <p>In reſpect of God himſelfe there is no cauſe why we ſhould make
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48000:323"/>this petition on his behalfe; for as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt no need of any goods, Pſal.</hi> 16.1. So he ſtands not in need of any thing that can come to him by our meanes: if we would wiſh him any profit, <hi>the earth is his, and all that is therein, Pſal.</hi> 24. If pleaſure, there is with him <hi>torrens voluptatis,</hi> a River of pleaſure, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 16.11. Wherefore albeit that in his owne eſſence and nature he be perfect, yet <hi>extrinſecus aſſumpſit ſibi nomen,</hi> he tooke himſelfe a name from without, he calls himſelfe the Lord Almighty: not that any terme can ſufficiently expreſſe him and his eſſence, but to the end, that while wee have a reverend regard of his Name, hee might receive ſome ſervice at our hands.</p>
                           <p>The account that men do make of their name, is ſuch as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>A good name is more to be deſired then great treaſure; it is more worth then pretious oyntment, Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1.5. God accounts, that we do not onely greatly profit him, but do procure great delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to him, when we reverence his holy name; which how preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous it is, it doth appeare hereby, that he ſetteth the hallowing of his name before his kingdome.</p>
                           <p>Many of the Kings ſubjects that are in the fartheſt parts of the land, never ſee his face all their life time, and yet in reverence to his name are ready to make long journeyes, to appeare when they are commanded in his name; and ſo it fareth with us that live on earth: for, <hi>Deum nemo vidit unquam, Joh.</hi> 18. Nay, very few are admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſee his back-parts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. But though wee cannot ſee his face, yet as thoſe are counted dutifull ſubjects that do not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the Princes perſon, but obey ſuch commandements as come in his name: ſo looke what duty wee do to Gods name here on earth, he reckons it to be as good ſervice, as that which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the Angels in heaven, that alwaies behold his face, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>And reaſon it is that we ſhould eſteeme of Gods name, for as in time of trouble, <hi>Turris altiſsima nomen Domini,</hi> the Name of the Lord is a ſtrong Tower, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.10. So being delivered once of danger, yet we are ſure of the ſalvation of our ſoules, and ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>Beſides there is no other name given under heaven, by which men can be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. And therefore ought by good right to receive ſanctification of us.</p>
                           <p>Howbeit we may not hereupon ground that errour, which ſome gather upon theſe words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. where it is ſaid, <hi>That God hath tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen us in Chriſt to the praiſe of the glory of his grace:</hi> not that God is deſirous of vaine-glory, he is not to receive any thing from us; but contrary-wiſe as he is good, ſo he is deſirous to communicate his goodneſſe to us: but the care that he hath for the ſanctifying of his name, ariſeth from the duty which man oweth unto him: In which regard ſuch as have beene moſt religious in all times, have reared up Altars, and ſet up Temples in honour of Gods Name.</p>
                           <p>The account of this Petition is that which maketh the difference betwixt the Papiſts and religious people, betweene Heretickes and the true worſhippers of God, that the one eſteemeth highly of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48000:324"/>the Name of God, the other doth not.</p>
                           <p>We uſually account of mens names, according to the worth of their perſons: but God himſelfe is holy, therefore he tels us, that his name alſo is holy: as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Holy and reverent is his Name, Pſal.</hi> 111.9. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 9.9. and it is not onely holy in it ſelfe, but it gives holineſſe unto all things that are holy.</p>
                           <p>The word of God is holy, becauſe it is publiſhed in <hi>nomine Dei,</hi> wherefore the name of God being holy in it ſelfe, needs not be hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by us, that can neither adde holineſſe to it, nor take any from it; but when God willeth us to hallow his Name, it is to prove us, that by glorifying his Name, we may ſhew how we glorifie God himſelfe, and what reckoning we make of him, that God may have proofe how we do with the <hi>Virgin magnifie God our Saviour, Luk.</hi> 2. and how we do <hi>glorifie God in our bodies, and in our ſpirits,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>The Name of God muſt be conſidered in two ſorts, either as it is expreſſed by the terme of <hi>Lord, Father, Lord Almighty,</hi> or elſe as it is expreſſed in ſuch things as beare his name, as he ſpeaketh of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 23. <hi>Behold I will ſend my Angel before thee, beware of him, and heare his voyce, &amp;c. quia nomen meum eſt in eo.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Touching the expreſſed name of God, whether it be <hi>Father,</hi> which importeth his <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> or <hi>Lord,</hi> which implyeth his <hi>power,</hi> as we may not account baſely of them, ſo we muſt not uſe them light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and negligently, but upon juſt occaſion.</p>
                           <p>The things that have the name of God impreſſed and imprinted in them, are either thoſe perſons which have their denomination of God, either joyntly, as the <hi>Church,</hi> which is called <hi>ſancta Eccleſia Dei,</hi> or ſeverally, as the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> of whom <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let thy Urim and thy Thummim bee with thy holy one, Deut.</hi> 33.</p>
                           <p>The Prieſts are called holy, becauſe they are conſecrated to the Lord: In which reſpect, as in the old Teſtament they are called <hi>vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri Dei;</hi> ſo in the New, they are <hi>vaſa nominis Dei,</hi> veſſels of the name of God, as the Lord ſpeakes in a viſion touching <hi>Saul</hi> to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanias,</hi> That <hi>he was a choſen veſſell to beare the Name of God among the Gentiles, Act.</hi> 9.15.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, thoſe places are ſaid to be Gods, which are conſecrated to holy uſes, as the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> which is <hi>Domus Dei,</hi> and all thoſe pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, where he puts the <hi>remembrance of his Name,</hi> and whither he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth that he will come <hi>to bleſſe his people that are aſſembled there for his worſhip, Exod.</hi> 20.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>thoſe times which are kept holy to the Lord, as the Sabbath,</hi> which is <hi>dies Domini, Rev.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the <hi>Word of God preached in Gods name.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, the <hi>Element conſecrated in the Sacrament, for a holy uſe,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therefore, <hi>panis Dei, Joh.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>In all theſe there is an impreſſion of Gods name, and therefore we muſt not lightly account of them, but ſhew great reverence to them, that thereby we may teſtifie the high and reverent regard and eſtimation we have of God himſelfe, for ſanctification is when God is ſaid to magnifie or glorifie.</p>
                           <pb n="65" facs="tcp:48000:324"/>
                           <p>It ſignifies to make great and glorious: ſo when ſanctification is given to him, it betokeneth to make holy, but when we are ſaid to ſanctifie, that is, to account holy; when we magnifie God, that is <hi>magnifacere Deum,</hi> to eſteeme greatly of God; and our glorifying of God is to account him glorious: ſo that when we pray, <hi>Hallowed be thy Name,</hi> our deſire is, that Gods name which is holy of it ſelfe, may be ſo accounted of us; and be holily uſed by us.</p>
                           <p>And whereas he ſaith not <hi>glorificetur,</hi> or <hi>magnificetur nomen tuum,</hi> glorified, or magnified by thy Name, but <hi>ſanctificetur, hallowed,</hi> or <hi>ſanctified</hi> be thy Name, it is to the end, that we receiving the ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of Gods ſpirit, might have a holy regard of his Name; for things may be accounted great and glorious by thoſe which are accounted neither great nor glorious: but <hi>ſanctificetur</hi> cannot come from any perſons that are prophane, but onely ſuch perſons as are holy: therefore the Angels in heaven cry not, <hi>Glorious, Glorious,</hi> but <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Eſay</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>The title that <hi>Aaron</hi> ware upon his breaſt, was not <hi>Glory,</hi> but <hi>Holineſſe unto the Lord, Exod.</hi> 28. And the foure beaſts ceaſed not to cry day and night, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, Rev.</hi> 4.8.</p>
                           <p>The duties which pertaine to the ſanctifying of Gods name, are two.
<list>
                                 <item>Firſt, that againſt which we do <hi>Deprecari,</hi> or pray to be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved:</item>
                                 <item>ſecondly, that for which wee do pray, or deſire to be granted.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, wee are to pray, that we may not uſe the name of God, which is <hi>Wonderfull</hi> and <hi>Holy,</hi> either <hi>contemptuouſly</hi> to Magicke, or curſing, or <hi>negligently</hi> abuſe it upon any ſlight occaſion; becauſe that holy things are to be ſeparated from a common uſe, and are not to be uſed but when neceſſity requireth.</p>
                           <p>We ſee by experience that the holy name of God hath not that reverence which it ought to have, and therefore the perſons which do take it in vaine, do oftentimes pull upon themſelves the plagues and vengeance of God by that ſinne: for God doth in juſtice pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch offenders, not becauſe the name of God can receive any pollution by mens default; but becauſe we doe, <hi>quantum in nobis eſt,</hi> as farre as in us lyeth, pollute the holy name of God, even as hee that <hi>looketh after a woman to luſt after her, hath already committed the ſinne of uncleanneſſe,</hi> although ſhe be not a whit the leſſe chaſte for his luſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>The Heathen faile in this duty, becauſe they do <hi>appropriate the name of God to foure-footed beaſts, Rom.</hi> 1.23. <hi>And change the glory of God, who is incorruptible into the ſimilitude of mortall man.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Jew ſinneth, becauſe he contemnes the name of JESUS, which is <hi>a name above all names, Phil.</hi> 2. and deſpiſeth the name of CHRIST, the preciouſneſſe whereof appeareth herein, by that that it is <hi>Oleum effuſum, an ointment powred out, Cant.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>But as we are to pray againſt the <hi>contemptuous abuſe</hi> of Gods name, ſo we are to pray that we do not <hi>negligently,</hi> or careleſly uſe it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that reverent eſtimation, and regard, that is due to it; that we tread not under feete the Sonne of God, nor account of the <hi>blood of the Teſtament, whereby we are fanctified, as a common thing, Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
                           <pb n="66" facs="tcp:48000:325"/>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were debarred from entring into the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> not becauſe they <hi>polluted</hi> Gods name; but for that they did not <hi>ſanctifie the Lord among the children of Iſrael at the waters of ſtrife, Deut.</hi> 32.51.</p>
                           <p>Therefore as we pray againſt the <hi>contempt</hi> and <hi>negligent</hi> uſe of Gods name; ſo we muſt pray, that we may have a due regard of it: Firſt, that we ſanctifie Gods name <hi>in our hearts,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. Secondly, we muſt not uſe the name of God with our tongues but ſeriouſly, and therefore we are forbidden to take it in vain in the third Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. Thirdly, in all our actions we muſt not begin any thing that is extraordinary, but in the <hi>Name of the Lord that made heaven and earth, Pſal.</hi> 124. and men muſt referre the end of them to the <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his name,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>God, whoſe name is called upon by us, is holy, and Chriſt, of whom we are called Chriſtians, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. is holy; therefore we muſt ſanctifie God in our actions.</p>
                           <p>Neither do we pray, that we our ſelves onely may ſanctifie Gods name, but that others alſo may do the ſame, for Chriſt ſaith not, <hi>Sanctiſicemus,</hi> let us ſanctifie: but <hi>Sanctificetur,</hi> let thy name be ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified.</p>
                           <p>This is it whereunto the Prophet exhorteth, <hi>Laudate Dominum omnes Gentes, Laudate Dominum omnes populi, Pſal.</hi> 100. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 117. <hi>Praiſe the Lord all yee Nations, praiſe him all yee people;</hi> that is for perſons.</p>
                           <p>For places, <hi>The Lords name be prayſed from the riſing of the Sunne to the going downe of the ſame, Pſal.</hi> 113.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, for the time, <hi>Bleſſed be the name of the Lord from this time forth for evermore, Pſal.</hi> 113.</p>
                           <p>But becauſe it cannot generally be ſanctified, except it be known, we muſt deſire that all may know God, and pray with the Prophet, <hi>Let thy way be knowne upon earth, and thy ſaving health among all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Pſal.</hi> 67.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, not to know it only, but cheerfully to go forward in the profeſſion of Gods truth, and in the worſhip of his name: <hi>Thou haſt multiplyed the people, but not increaſed their joy, Eſay</hi> 9.2. But wee are to pray that as all Nations know his name, ſo that they may ſo carry it and profeſſe it, as that the Heathen may not have occaſion to ſay ſcoffingly, <hi>Populus Dei eſt iſte, Ezek.</hi> 36.20. We muſt deſire of God that all that profeſſe his name may ſo carry themſelves, that for their ſakes <hi>the name of God may not be evill ſpoken of among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, Rom.</hi> 2. But contrariwiſe, that they may ſhine as lights in the world, among <hi>a froward and crooked generation, Phil.</hi> 2. That they may <hi>by their good workes ſtirre up all men to glorifie our heavenly Father, Matth.</hi> 5. and <hi>by their good converſation, without the word, winne thoſe that obey not the Word,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.2.</p>
                           <p>We are to deſire that ſuch as have not yet cared to performe this duty, may now begin, that ſuch as have begun to ſanctifie Gods name, may goe forwards, and that ſuch as are fallen away from God, and pollute that holy Name, which ſometimes they did
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48000:325"/>highly eſteeme, may <hi>reſipiſcere,</hi> that being renewed by repentance, they may recover themſelves out of <hi>Relapſes,</hi> that they may be of the ſociety of Angels, that cry continually, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Eſay</hi> 6. <hi>Rev.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>We muſt be carefull not for our ſelves onely, but for thoſe over whom we have power, that they may ſanctifie Gods name and account it holy; that the Heathen may not take occaſion to pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute the holy name of the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Are theſe the people of the Lord?</hi> but that while they behold our good converſation, they may have occaſion to ſay, <hi>Verily God is in you,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.1 <hi>Cor</hi> 14.25.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Tuum nomen,</hi> thy name; men are given generally to give a kind of honour to God, but in the meane time they will have themſelves honoured, but here they are taught otherwiſe. It is our duty to aſcribe all glory to God; <hi>Non nobis, ſed nomini tuo da gloriam, Not unto us O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give the glory, Pſal.</hi> 115. So that all men are no leſſe deſirous of their owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory, then the builders that built <hi>Babell,</hi> that ſaid, <hi>Let us get us a name, Gen.</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>But ſuch as are thus affected, and carried with the love of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are not fit to ſanctifie the name of God, as our Saviour ſpeakes, <hi>How can yee beleeve, ſeeing yee receive glory one of another, and ſeeke not the glory which is of God? Joh.</hi> 5.44.</p>
                           <p>As we may not uſurpe Gods honour for our ſelves, ſo we may not defie Princes: for we ſee how ill that voyce was taken, <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>x Dei &amp; non hominis, the voyce of God and not of man, Act.</hi> 12. neither may we give divine honour to the Apoſtles and Prophets of God. The Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then people ſaid of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Gods are come downe to us in the ſhape of men,</hi> and they would have ſacrificed unto them, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, not willing to admit this ſacriledge, <hi>rent their cloathes and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, We are men ſubject to the ſame paſsions that you your ſelves be, Act.</hi> 14. for we are deſirous to give honour, if not to our ſelves, yet to others; but here Chriſt tels us, that no other name is to be ſanctified but the name of God; whereof we ſhould be ſo carefull, that we ought to pray, that Gods name may be ſanctified by others, if not by our ſelves, though we in our owne perſons cannot hallow it, yet <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificetur nomen tuum,</hi> Let thy name O Lord be ſanctified.</p>
                           <p>Hereby, as we pray for the gift of the feare of God, which is one of the ſeven vertues which are ſet downe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 11. becauſe wee do truly ſanctifie God, when we make him our <hi>Feare and Dread, Eſay</hi> 8.13. So wee pray againſt the vice of pride which is the contrary to the vertue of <hi>Feare,</hi> ſo ſhall we obtaine the bleſſings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.23. <hi>Bleſſed are the poore in ſpirit, &amp;c.</hi> And upon this petition is grounded, not only whatſoever <hi>Hymne</hi> or <hi>Pſalme</hi> is ſung of the Congregation, but even the <hi>end</hi> of all Aſſemblies is to aſcribe Holineſſe to God, and to ſanctifie his Name for his benefits beſtowed upon us.</p>
                           <p>And in this they acknowledge, firſt, their owne unworthineſſe: ſecondly, they bleſſe him for his goodneſſe extended toward them: thirdly they do not acknowledge it in themſelves, but do tell it forth as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaketh: <hi>O come hither and hearken, all yee that do feare
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48000:326"/>God, and I will tell you what he hath done for my ſoule, Pſal.</hi> 66. Fourthly, to this end they lift up their voyces in ſinging, <hi>to the end they may make the voyce of his praiſe to be heard, Pſal.</hi> 66.</p>
                           <p>And among other benefits, we are to praiſe and bleſſe his name for the benefit of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which we have in the name of the Lord <hi>Jeſus:</hi> ſecondly, for the <hi>Meanes</hi> whereby this <hi>Sanctification</hi> is offered and wrought in us, which is the <hi>Word,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith: <hi>O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſanctifie them in thy truth, Joh.</hi> 17.13. For the perfection of ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification that we ſhall have after this life, when we ſhall be <hi>Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the inheritance of the Saints in light, Col.</hi> 1.12. when we ſhall continually ſing with the heavenly Angels, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God of Hoſts, Eſay</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>And howſoever, when we deſire of God that his name may be ſanctified, we ſeeme like naturall children to forget our owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities in reſpect of the care we have to Gods glory; yet even then, we pray no leſſe for our ſelves then for God, for the Lord hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: <hi>Them that honour mee I will honour,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.30. and <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſaith: <hi>That if the Name of the Lord Jeſus be glorified in us, we alſo ſhall be glorified in him,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Et ſanctificando nomen, adveniet Regnum:</hi> In ſanctifying his name, his kingdome ſhall come, as the next Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition is.</p>
                           <p>If while we remaine on earth, our whole deſire be to ſanctifie Gods name, we ſhall at length come to the place where we ſhall <hi>day and night ſing as the Cherubims do, Eſay</hi> 6.

                              <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Aving intreated of the firſt petition, touching the holy eſtimation of Gods name, we are conſequently to ſpeake of thoſe ſixe that concerne our ſelves, whereof the firſt three are ſpent in <hi>praying for that which is good,</hi> in the other three we pray for the <hi>removing of evill;</hi> The firſt two petitions, or the ſumme of them, is excellently expreſſed by the Propher, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11. And by our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.33. for agreeable to the words of <hi>David,</hi> and of Chriſt our Saviour, in the firſt petition wee aske for glory, and ſeeke for the Kingdome of God; in the ſecond, for grace and righteouſneſſe: in the third, for the good things of this life, which ſhall not be withheld from them that leade a godly life, but ſhall be miniſtred unto them that upon earth doe ſeeke Gods Kingdome, and the righteouſneſſe thereof.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore as of things which concerne our good, the firſt, both in order and nature, is the Kingdome of God; for the firſt thing in our deſire ought to be the Kingdome of God, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of our Saviour, and we are to <hi>account all things but dung in reſpect of it, Phil.</hi> 3.9. Hereunto is required the ſpirit of <hi>Wiſedome, and Vnderſtanding, Iſa.</hi> 11.2. that may teach us to contemne all earthly pleaſures, in reſpect of the heavenly Kingdome.</p>
                           <p>Here our Saviour condemneth that capitall vice that reignes in thoſe men which in the world live of their owne, and take no further care but to eſtabliſh for themſelves a Kingdome upon earth. But if (according to his direction) we fixe our deſire upon the Kingdome of Heaven, and by deſpiſing the world, doe labour for the vertue, which conſiſts in the purity of the heart, then ſhall we have the bleſſing that is promiſed to the pure in heart, <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. that is, <hi>they ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to ſee God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now when he ſaith, <hi>None ſhall ſee my face and live, Exod.</hi> 33. they that truly make this prayer ſhall behold his face in the Kingdome of glory.</p>

                           <p>Theſe two firſt petitions have relation to the <hi>Invocation;</hi> for as God by the word <hi>Father</hi> doth expreſſe his love to us, and for that he is in Heaven, doth give us hope for an heavenly eſtate; ſo we in theſe petitions doe firſt deſire that whereby our love towards him may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, while we prefer the ſanctifying of his name before the regard of our owne good: ſecondly, we declare our heavenly <hi>Hope</hi> that may come of being partakers of his heavenly Kingdome.</p>
                           <p>Howſoever God will not have any mans name <hi>Hallowed,</hi> or <hi>Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified</hi> but his owne, as he ſpeakes of himſelfe, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 42. <hi>My glory will I not give to another:</hi> yet he will communicate his <hi>Kingdome</hi> to us: and therefore in our owne behalfe weare taught to pray: <hi>Thy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome come.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the petition we are to conſider two things:
<list>
                                 <item>Firſt, the <hi>Kingdome it ſelfe:</hi>

                           </p>
                           <p>Touching the firſt point it may be objected, how it is that Chriſt teacheth us to make this petition: for <hi>Gods Kingdome is an everlaſting Kingdome, and his Dominion endureth throughout all ages, Pſal.</hi> 145.13. How then is it ſaid to come? For the anſwer of this doubt, the <hi>Kingdome</hi> of God muſt be diſtinguiſhed.

                                 <item>Secondly, there is a <hi>Kingdome of Glory,</hi> that whereof our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.34.</item>
                              </list> 
                              <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdome prepared for you, &amp;c.</hi> And the thiefe upon the Croſſe ſaid, <hi>Lord remember me when thou commeſt into thy Kingdome, Luke</hi> 13. and this is the Kingdome which in the firſt place Chriſt teacheth us to pray for: we pray for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that it may come: we pray for our owne good, for it is a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of power, and therefore able to defend us: and therefore our Saviour in the concluſion of his prayer, addeth this, <hi>For thine is the Kingdome, Matth.</hi> 6. According to which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith: <hi>Thy Saints give thankes to thee, they ſhew the glory of thy Kingdome, and talke of thy power, Pſal.</hi> 145.11.</p>
                           <p>The government of his Kingdome is committed to Chriſt, of whom it was ſaid by God: <hi>I have ſet my King upon my holy Hill of Sion, Pſal.</hi> 2.

                           <p>Secondly, there is a Kingdome of ſinne, againſt which the Apoſtle exhorteth: <hi>Let not ſinne reigne in your mortall bodies, Rom</hi> 6 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Thirdly, the Apoſtle ſheweth, that <hi>Death</hi> hath a <hi>Kingdome,</hi> when he ſaith, that <hi>by meanes of ſinne death reigned from</hi> Adam <hi>to</hi> Moſes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are enemies to the Kingdome of God; for while the Devill reighneth by meanes of ſinne, as he doth ſo long as he worketh in the <hi>children of diſobedience, Epheſ.</hi> 4. he taketh away the glory of Gods Kingdome, and Death takes away the power of it.</p>
                           <p>And in regard of Sathans Kingdome, he is ſaid to be <hi>a King over all the children of pride, Iob</hi> 41.34. For he makes the whole world rebell againſt God, ſo that they are not aſhamed to deny him to his face; and that is true not onely of the common ſort of the world, but even of a great many of the Church, of which number are thoſe that ſticke not to ſay, <hi>We will not have Christ to rule over us, Luke</hi> 19.14.</p>
                           <p>Againe, there are many ſtumbling blocks for the hinderance of Gods Kingdome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.41. that the Kingdome of God cannot come; and therefore we doe worthily pray as well that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Sathan and ſinne may be overthrowne, as for the removing of thoſe offences.</p>
                           <p>God having exalted his Sonne into the higheſt Heaven, ſaith unto him, <hi>Sit thou at my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy foot-stoole, Pſal.</hi> 110.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>The laſt enemy that is to be deſtroyed, is death,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.16. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our deſire is, that there may be ſuch a Kingdome, as wherein the Law of God may be exactly kept, and that it would pleaſe God in this Kingdome to <hi>tread downe Sathan under our feete, Rom.</hi> 16. that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death it ſelfe, but he that hath the <hi>power of death being deſtroyed, Heb.</hi> 2.14. <hi>God may be all in all,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.28.</p>
                           <p>When we behold the ſtate of the world, and ſee that good men are trodden under feete, and the veſſels of wrath and ſinne are exalted and proſper, then we may know that that is not the true Kingdome, and therefore we pray that God will ſet up his Kingdome in our hearts, and governe us by his Spirit.</p>
                           <p>And therefore this point doth not onely concerne our ſelves, but alſo God, for unleſſe his Kingdome come, his name cannot be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of us.</p>
                           <p>As there are <hi>temporall Kingdomes,</hi> ſo there is a <hi>ſpirituall Kingdome,</hi> called the <hi>Kingdome of Grace,</hi> whereof our Saviour ſpeaketh, <hi>The King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God is within you, Luke</hi> 17.21.</p>
                           <p>As before we prayed for the <hi>Kingdome of Glory,</hi> ſo now for this <hi>Kingdome of Grace;</hi> for, without this we ſhall never bee partakers of that other Kingdome.</p>
                           <p>The glory of other Kingdomes is the reformation of things that were before amiſſe; but the glory of the Kingdome of Grace is, that, as during the tyranny of Sathan, <hi>Sinne raigned unto death,</hi> ſo now under this Kingdome, <hi>Grace may raigne through righteouſneſſe by Ieſus Chriſt, Rom.</hi> 5.21.</p>
                           <p>That we may have intereſt in both theſe Kingdomes, wee muſt hearken to that which Chriſt proclaimeth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.27. <hi>Repent, for the Kingdome of God draweth neare:</hi> as it draweth neare to us, ſo wee
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48000:328"/>muſt draw neare to it, elſe we ſhall never enter into it, for, <hi>except a man be borne againe, he cannot enter into the Kingdome of God, Iohn</hi> 3.2.</p>
                           <p>And that we may beginne to draw neare to it, there is an outward <hi>regiment</hi> to be uſed, which is a token of the grace of God bearing rule in our hearts; we muſt by the Kingdome of God within us, <hi>caſt out Devils, Matth.</hi> 8. We muſt intreate God by the power of his Spirit to <hi>plant in our hearts</hi> that which is good, and to <hi>roote out,</hi> and remove out of them that which is bad, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.48. We muſt diſplace Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than and ſinne, that they ſet not up their thrones in our hearts, and in ſtead of it, we muſt ſet up Gods Kingdome, ruling in us by his Spirit, for the Kingdome of God ſtands <hi>in righteouſneſſe, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 14.17.</p>
                           <p>If we finde theſe vertues in us, they are ſure pledges of the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Grace,</hi> and we may aſſure our ſelves, that after this life is ended, we ſhall be received into the <hi>Kingdome of Glory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And how ſoever he hath appointed Kings and Rulers over us for our outward ſafety and defence, yet they have their Scepter from him, and the end of their rule is, to further Gods Kingdome, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaketh, <hi>That we may live under them, in all godlineſſe and honeſty,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>Touching the comming of his Kingdome, it may be demanded why we pray that it may come to us, ſeeing that it were meeter that we ſhould come toward it? But hereby Chriſt giveth us to underſtand what our corruption is: It is with us, as with the Iſraelites, that were ſo addicted to the <hi>fleſh-pois of Egypt,</hi> that they cared not to goe into the <hi>promiſed land,</hi> likewiſe we are ſo in love with this preſent world, as that we have no minde of Heaven.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, there are ſo many ſtumbling-blocks in our way, as that the Kingdome of God muſt come unto us, or elſe we ſhall never poſſibly come unto it. Therefore, as we pray that God would lighten our blind eyes, and inflame our hard hearts with a love of his heavenly King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ſo alſo, that he would ſend his <hi>Angels to gather out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, all things that offend, Matth.</hi> 13.41.</p>
                           <p>The things that we pray againſt, are the <hi>Kingdome of Sathan, darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and <hi>ſinne,</hi> that they may depart from us, and that the <hi>inward King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Grace</hi> may take place in our hearts, but the principall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome that we deſire is the <hi>Kingdome of Glory,</hi> whereof our Saviour ſaid, <hi>Behold, I come quickly, Revel.</hi> 22.7.</p>
                           <p>This is the Kingdome which the Saints deſire, ſaying, <hi>Come quickly, Lord Ieſus, Revel.</hi> 22.20. and all creatures doe waite for this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, looking when they ſhall be <hi>made free from the bondage of their corruption, Rom.</hi> 8.20. For whereas now all things are ſubject unto vanity, then there ſhall be a Kingdome that ſhall not periſh.</p>
                           <p>It is not for the wicked to deſire the comming of his Kingdome; <hi>Woe be to you that deſire the comming of the Lord, it is darkneſſe, and not light, Amos</hi> 5.18. The wicked ſhall ſay to the Mountaines, <hi>Fall upon us, for the wrath of the Lord no man is able to abide it, Revel.</hi> 6.16. But to the godly, it is a day of comfort, <hi>Lift up your heads, for the day of redemption drawes neare, Luke</hi> 21.33. Howſoever, hee will render ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48000:328"/>to the ungodly that have <hi>not knowne nor obeyed the Goſpel of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.8. Yet he comes to make a garland to crowne the godly, and to ſet them in his throne, they ſhall be received into his <hi>Kingdome of glory,</hi> where they ſhall injoy the things, which <hi>neither eye hath ſeene, nor eare hath heard, nor hath ever entred into the heart of man, which he hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>Therefore Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to bee with Chriſt, Phil.</hi> 3. <hi>Simeons</hi> deſire is, <hi>Lord, now let thou thy ſervant depart in peace, Luke</hi> 2.29.</p>
                           <p>Thus the remembrance of the day of our redemption is a joyfull remembrance to them, and the chiefe thing that they deſire, ſo that they are willing to depart, in regard of their future hope, rather then to tarry here: and howbeit that Chriſt deferres his Kingdome and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, yet we are to be watchfull, for <hi>it will come as a ſnare, Luke</hi> 21. and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5. and when he commeth he will rather be for us, then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>The Petitions of <hi>glory,</hi> and <hi>Gods Kingdome,</hi> have already beene han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled: Now in this third (which is the ſecond of thoſe which concerne our ſelves) we are ſuiters for the grace of God in this life, whereby we may be enabled to doe his will here, that ſo we may obtaine the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of glory</hi> in the world to come: for the <hi>Kingdome of God, and of glory</hi> is the Heaven that we deſire all to arrive at, and <hi>grace and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe</hi> is the gale of wind that drives us forward thereunto, and our ſuite to God in this petition is, that by doing of his will here on earth, <hi>Grace may raigne in our hearts by righteouſneſſe, Rom.</hi> 5.21. that ſo here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we may raigne with him in <hi>glory.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He doth not onely will us to <hi>ſeeke Gods Kingdome, Matth.</hi> 6. And tels us that there is one <hi>prepared for us before the foundation of the world, Matth.</hi> 25.34. but alſo how we may finde it, and attaine to it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7. <hi>Not every one that ſaith, Lord, Lord, ſhalt enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, but he that ſhall doe the will of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Therefore touching the order of this prayer, as of thoſe things which concerne our good, the firſt is, that <hi>Gods Kingdome may come to us:</hi> ſo the <hi>doore</hi> whereby we muſt enter into the ſame, is the doing of Gods will, and therefore in the ſecond place we are taught, that the <hi>Kingdome of God</hi> ſhall come, not by wiſhing or deſiring, but by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods will, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>The Kingdome of God is come neare you.</hi> So Chriſt tels us, <hi>If we draw neare to God, he will draw neare to us, Iames</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Touching the <hi>Will</hi> of God, it may be demanded, Why we ſhould demand, and aske this petition; For as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>Our God
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48000:329"/>is in Heaven, he doth whatſoever he will, Pſal.</hi> 115. <hi>Whatſoever the Lord willed, that did he, in Heaven, in the earth, and in all deepe places, Pſal.</hi> 135.6. and <hi>who hath reſiſted his will? Rom.</hi> 9.19. <hi>No counſell or wiſedome can prevaile against the Lord, Prov.</hi> 21.30. And if any doe oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt his will, yet they doe but <hi>kicke againſt the prickes, Acts</hi> 9.</p>
                           <p>The anſwer to this objection is, that we pray not ſo much that Gods will may be done, but rather, that, what God willeth, may bee our will; for there is one will of God which we may reſiſt, another which we may not reſiſt.</p>
                           <p>For the diſtinction of Gods will, it is either <hi>hidden and ſecret,</hi> or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed and open,</hi> the one is that which the Prophet cals the <hi>counſell or thought of his heart, Pſal.</hi> 33.11. The other is that will of his word, wherein the declareth and openeth to men what his will is.</p>
                           <p>His <hi>ſecret will</hi> is, <hi>voluntas beneplaciti,</hi> the good pleaſure of his will; his <hi>revealed will</hi> is, <hi>voluntas ſigni,</hi> which is diſcloſed to us.</p>
                           <p>Gods <hi>ſecret will</hi> is, <hi>voluntas quam Deus vult,</hi> that will which God willeth; his <hi>revealed will</hi> is, <hi>voluntas quam ipſe nos velle vult,</hi> that will which he willeth us to will; the <hi>ſecret will of his heart</hi> is, <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas adoranda, non ſcrutanda: He that curiouſly ſearcheth the glory of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly things, ſhall not enter into glory, Prov.</hi> 25.27. <hi>How unſearchable are his judgements? Rom.</hi> 11. and <hi>who hath knowen the will of the Lord? or who was his counſellour?</hi> But the <hi>open</hi> and <hi>revealed will</hi> of God is, <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas ſcrutanda, &amp; ſacienda,</hi> both to be ſearched out, and to be done of us. <hi>Be not unwiſe, but underſtand what is the will of God, Epheſ.</hi> 5.17. The knowledge of his will is not enough, but as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If yee know theſe things, bleſſed are ye if ye doe them, Iohn</hi> 13.17.</p>
                           <p>Of the <hi>ſecret will</hi> of God, that is true which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Who hath reſiſled his wil? Rom.</hi> 9. and therefore we pray not that that will may be done.</p>
                           <p>Of his revealed will, that is verified which Chriſt complaineth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. <hi>Quoties volui congregare vos, &amp; noluiſtis? How often would I gather you together, but yee would not?</hi> God often times willeth when we will not, and therefore we have neede to pray that his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will</hi> may be accompliſhed in us.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Moſes</hi> thus diſtinguiſheth Gods will, <hi>Secreta Deo noſtro, quae autem revelavit, nobis, &amp; filiis noſtris, Deut.</hi> 29. <hi>The things that are ſecret be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to God, but the revealed are for us, and our children.</hi> The <hi>ſecret will</hi> of the Father is, <hi>that of all that he hath given me, I ſhould loſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, Iohn</hi> 6.39.

                           <p>Gods judgements, which are the fountaine of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> are <hi>abyſſus magna, Pſal.</hi> 36.6. and his mercie extended to all, that by faith apprehend the ſame, is <hi>abyſſus &amp; profunditas, a great depth, Rom.</hi> 11.37. Therefore we are not curiouſly to enquire and ſearch out of Gods ſecret touching <hi>Reprobation</hi> or <hi>Election,</hi> but to adore it.</p>
                           <p>His <hi>revealed will</hi> doth eſpecially concerne us, which is expreſſed in his Commandements; whereby hee declareth whatſoever hee deſireth at our hands, and therefore our ſtudy muſt bee to

                           <p>Unto both theſe wils, we muſt give a <hi>fiat;</hi> but ſeverally.</p>
                           <p>The firſt will is <hi>paſſive,</hi> and for as much as the <hi>ſecret will</hi> of God ſhall be done whether we will or no, we crave that with patience we may ſubmit our ſelves to whatſoever he in his ſecret will hath appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bring upon us.</p>
                           <p>The other will is <hi>active,</hi> and therein we deſire, that we may willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſe that which he willeth in his word.</p>
                           <p>There is <hi>voluntas de nobis,</hi> and <hi>voluntas in nobis;</hi> for the firſt, we deſire that we may approve of it, though it be done without us: in the ſecond, we deſire not onely an approbation, but a co-operation.</p>
                           <p>Touching his ſecret will, when we ſay <hi>fiat voluntas tua,</hi> we pray that <hi>Nihil Dei diſpliceat nobis,</hi> that nothing which God commands diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe us, and in reſpect of his <hi>will declared,</hi> our deſire is, that <hi>nihil noſtrum diſpliceat Deo,</hi> that nothing we doe, doe diſpleaſe God.</p>
                           <p>Touching his <hi>ſecret will,</hi> ſo long as it is not plaine <hi>(within his owne counſell he will compaſſe)</hi> we may diſſent from it, for a man may <hi>bona voluntate velle, quod Deus non vult;</hi> hee may with a <hi>good will,</hi> will that which God wils not, ſo <hi>Samuels will</hi> was good, when he <hi>wept for Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Secondly, we may <hi>bona voluntate nolle quod deus vult,</hi> with a <hi>good will</hi> not will that which God willeth: as a child may be unwilling of the death of his Father, whom notwithſtanding Gods <hi>will</hi> is, ſhall not recover.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, men may <hi>mala voluntate velle, quod Deus non vult,</hi> with an ill will he may will that which God willeth not: The Patriarches in a <hi>corrupt will</hi> would goe into <hi>Egypt,</hi> whom God would not to goe thither.</p>
                           <p>And fourthly, they may in a <hi>corrupt will</hi> be unwilling to that which God willeth: So it was Gods <hi>will</hi> that <hi>Saul</hi> ſhould be King, when as the people were unwilling to it; and this is the ſtate of the <hi>will</hi> of the creature, ſo long as it is not acquainted with the <hi>will</hi> of his Creator.</p>

We muſt not wreſtle nor ſtruggle againſt it; but patiently ſubmit our <hi>wils</hi> to his, not onely when Gods <hi>will</hi> is <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas dulcis,</hi> when his <hi>will</hi> is to doe us good, as <hi>Bethuel</hi> ſpake <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the marriage of his daughter, Gen.</hi> 24.50. but when it is <hi>Amara &amp; averſa voluntas,</hi> we muſt ſubmit our wils to his, when it pleaſeth him to croſſe us, either outwardly, by taking away thoſe that are bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall to us: in which caſe it was ſaid by ſome, that bewailed the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture of Saint <hi>Paul, The will of the Lord be done, Act.</hi> 21.14. or in our ſelves, in which caſe we may ſay with Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 23. <hi>I would have this cup paſſe from me; yet O Father, if thy will be other wayes, not my will, but thy will be done.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This leſſon had <hi>David</hi> learned; for albeit he had complained of the great affliction that he had ſuffered; yet he ſaith, <hi>Tacui tamen Domine, Pſal.</hi> 39. And as he was content to beare this, ſo he gave God thanks
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48000:330"/>for them, acknowledging, <hi>That is was good for him that he had beene in trouble, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>We muſt learne <hi>Iobs</hi> fruits, <hi>Iob</hi> 1. as well as <hi>Bethuels,</hi> and theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joyned, we ſhall perfectly conforme our <hi>wils</hi> to Gods <hi>ſecret will.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Concerning the <hi>will of God declared,</hi> or the will of his word, the Lord by his Prophet ſaith of his Church, <hi>My will is in it,</hi> but <hi>David</hi> ſpeakes more plainely of this revealed will, <hi>Thou haſt charged that we ſhould keepe thy Commandements diligently, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle ſpeakes more particularly, <hi>haec eſt voluntas Dei, ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio veſtra,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. and <hi>this is the will of God, that by well-doing, yee ſhould ſtop the mouthes of ignorant and fooliſh men,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15.</p>
                           <p>This is the <hi>revealed will</hi> of God, and we muſt not onely take notice of it, but labour to practiſe that which in our underſtanding we know is meete to be done.</p>
                           <p>As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Oſlende mihi fidem ex operibus tuis, Iames</hi> 2. <hi>Shew methy faith by thy workes:</hi> So we muſt ſhew our deſire that wee have unto Gods Kingdome, by obedience of his will; for not they that ſing, or ſay, or wiſh, that Gods will be accompliſhed, but <hi>qui ſecerit, He which doth the will of God, ſhall enter into the Kingdome of God, Matth.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>To the doing of <hi>Gods will,</hi> two things are required: firſt, that wee lay aſide our <hi>owne will:</hi> For as they that will ſanctifie Gods name, muſt ſay with <hi>David, not to us, but to thy name give the praiſe. Pſal.</hi> 115. So that Gods will may be done, we muſt ſay with Chriſt, <hi>not my will, but thy will be done,</hi> we muſt abridge our ſelves of our <hi>owne will,</hi> that <hi>Gods will</hi> may take place.</p>
                           <p>The better ſort that are regenerate, doe <hi>aſſent to the Law of God, that it is good,</hi> and have a delight to it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22. but yet they ſee another <hi>law in their members, which leadeth them unto the law of ſinne and death.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Every man findes that to be true in himſelfe, that the <hi>fleſh luſteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh, Gal.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>will of the fleſh</hi> wils one thing, and the <hi>will of God</hi> another, therefore that <hi>Gods will</hi> may take place, we muſt renounce our <hi>owne will,</hi> and as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>willingly deny our ſelves, Matth.</hi> 16.24. We muſt oppoſe <hi>Gods will</hi> to the <hi>will of the fleſh,</hi> and the will of man, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.13.</p>
                           <p>We muſt pray unto God, <hi>Converte meum nolle in tuum velle,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my froward and <hi>unwilling will</hi> into <hi>thy will;</hi> and becauſe <hi>thy will</hi> is the <hi>true will, Inſereolem voluntatis tuae oleaſtro voluntatis meae,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graft the true Olive of <hi>thy will</hi> into the wilde Olive of <hi>my will.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If <hi>our will</hi> be contrary unto <hi>Gods will,</hi> and will not be ſubject unto it, then we muſt <hi>ſcatter it, and pull it up by the rootes, Pſal.</hi> 32.9. <hi>In chamo, &amp; fraeno conſtringe maxillas meas,</hi> (ſayes an ancient Father) and upon the words of Chriſt, <hi>Compell them to enter, that my houſe may bee full, Luke</hi> 24. ſaith he, <hi>Compelle me Domine intrare, ſi vocare non eſt ſais.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, that <hi>Gods will</hi> may be done in us, we muſt be poſſeſſed with a baſe conceit of our <hi>will,</hi> and have an high, and reverent opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Gods will:</hi> we muſt be perſwaded that our <hi>owne will</hi> is blinde, and childiſh, and perverſe, and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ne innitaris,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48000:331"/>&amp;c. Doe not leane to thine owne wiſedome, Prov.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Every man is a beaſt by his owne knowledge;</hi> and to expreſſe the fault of <hi>mans will, Iob</hi> ſaith, that man is <hi>tanquam pullus aſini,</hi> like an wilde Aſſes colt, <hi>Iob</hi> 11.12. which of all other beaſts is moſt fooliſh. But be hee never ſo wiſe naturally, yet he is but a foole in heavenly things, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> witneſſeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14.</p>
                           <p>Men ſpeake evill of things which they know not, yea, even in thoſe things <hi>which they know naturally they are but beaſts, Iudg.</hi> 10. All our reaſon and underſtanding hath not in it ſelfe ſufficient direction for our will: and therefore Chriſt ſaith of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that <hi>fleſh and bloud did not reveale to him</hi> that knowledge, that is attained by Gods Spirit, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. and in ſpirituall things, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> he <hi>counſelled not with fleſh and bloud, Gal.</hi> 1.16.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>our will</hi> is wholly <hi>enclined to that which is evill, Ier.</hi> 4. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one ſaith truly, <hi>Tolle voluntatem tuam, &amp; ego extinguam inferaum:</hi> take away thine owne will, and I will quench hell fire.</p>
                           <p>They that are given over to Satan, as the <hi>Inceſtuous Corinthians,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. may be reſtored, but thoſe whom God giveth over to their <hi>owne will, Rom.</hi> 1.24. their caſe is deſperate, and therefore wee have the more cauſe to thinke the more humbly of our <hi>owne will,</hi> and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ſubmit our ſelves to the holy will of God.</p>
                           <p>Touching both, Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Law is holy, and the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is holy, and juſt, and good, and the Law is ſpirituall, but I am car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, ſold under ſinne, Rom.</hi> 7.14.</p>
                           <p>But we muſt thinke honourably of <hi>Gods will:</hi> and this we cannot but doe, if we conſider, that <hi>his will</hi> is ſo perfect, as it needeth no rule to be guided by: but <hi>our will</hi> being crooked, and perverſe, muſt of neceſſity be directed by the rule of his holy will, or elſe we ſhall ſwerve out of the way.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Our will</hi> is blinde and fooliſh, but <hi>his will</hi> is full of counſell and wiſedome; <hi>our will</hi> is crooked, and perverſe, and froward, but <hi>his will</hi> is full of all goodneſſe; which we are to underſtand hereby, that he ſheweth himſelfe a Father to us: if a child be left to his owne will, it is as much as his life is worth, therefore <hi>with-hold not correction, but ſtrike him with the rod, and he ſhall not die, Prov.</hi> 22.13. and <hi>our will</hi> being childiſh, we muſt be abridged of it, or elſe, wee ſhall fall into danger: therefore we doe pray, that we may not onely ſubmit <hi>our will</hi> to Gods, but that we may utterly deny <hi>our owne will,</hi> being fooliſh: that Gods moſt <hi>holy will</hi> may take place in us: but we doe not onely pray, that we may have a will, and deſire to doe <hi>Gods will,</hi> but alſo abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and power; for of our ſelves we have no ſtrength to doe it; that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the petition it ſelfe, <hi>Nam quid stultius, quam petere id q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>od pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes nos est?</hi> What is more fooliſh then to aske thoſe things that are in our owne power? and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to thinke a good thought,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. Such is our corruption, <hi>That though God will, yet we will not, Matth.</hi> 23.</p>
                           <p>We cannot ſpeake unto God; for no man can ſay <hi>that Ieſus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghoſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>We doe not finde either will, or ability, but <hi>it is God that giveth
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48000:331"/>both, Phil.</hi> 2. and though the <hi>Spirit be willing, yet the fleſh is but weake, Matth.</hi> 26.41.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we are petitioners for the grace of God, and for power from him, without which we cannot doe <hi>Gods will,</hi> ſo that our deſire is, to obtaine ſomething from God, whereby <hi>his will</hi> may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed in us, for it is not ſaid, <hi>faciamus,</hi> or <hi>fac tis tuam voluntatem,</hi> let us doe, or doe thou thy will; but, <hi>fiat voluntas tua, thy will be done.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherein we are to conſider, <hi>a quo, &amp; per quem fiat,</hi> from whom, and by whom it is to be done, we pray not that we of our ſelves may doe the <hi>will of God;</hi> for no man can riſe up to Heaven, unleſſe hee firſt receive a grace from Heaven; <hi>He that is of the earth, ſpeaketh of the earth, Iohn</hi> 3. Therefore our ſuite is not onely for good thoughts, and heavenly deſires, but alſo for ability of grace; but this grace is either <hi>paſſive</hi> or <hi>active.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>paſsive</hi> grace is that, which proceeds from God towards us; which ſtandeth in <hi>offering grace,</hi> as God is ſaid to doe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. or when he cauſeth his grace <hi>to appeare to all men, Tit.</hi> 1.2.11. and that is not enough, unleſſe we be made capable of it; as it is invaine, that light doth ſhine, unleſſe we have eyes to ſee it; and therefore as hee offers grace, ſo he muſt give us grace, and enable us, <hi>to draw grace from him, Prov.</hi> 12.2. <hi>That he would powre grace into us, Zach.</hi> 12. That he would <hi>ſow in our hearts good thoughts, change our affections, and make them conformable to his will;</hi> and ſo though the thoughts of his heart ſeeme hard to fleſh and bloud, may for all that pleaſe us.</p>
                           <p>And laſt, our deſire is, <hi>ut induamur viriute ex alio, Luke</hi> 24. and he doth offer his grace, and doth powre it into us.</p>
                           <p>Then we muſt have that active <hi>grace,</hi> by which the will of God may be done in us, of which the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Omnia opera noſtra ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus es in nobis, Thou Lord hast wrought all our workes in us, Iſa.</hi> 26. God muſt not onely, <hi>ſanare cogitationem, &amp; mutare affectum,</hi> heale the thought, and change our affection, but <hi>perducere ad actum,</hi> that is, he muſt bring to paſſe, that as he gives us ability to doe <hi>his will,</hi> ſo <hi>his will</hi> may be done by us; we muſt ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27. <hi>Thou art my helpe, for ſake me not, O God of my ſalvation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As he prevents us with his grace, by giving us both a will, and a power, ſo he muſt ſtill follow us with his grace, that we may goe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in doing of <hi>his will,</hi> for our caſe is compared to the ſtate of the Iſraelites, which in their fight with <hi>Amalek,</hi> did prevaile, <hi>as long as</hi> Moſes <hi>held up his hand; but when he let is downe, they were put to the worſe, Exod.</hi> 17. we may ſee it in the caſe of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who was <hi>able to walk upon the water, while Chriſt held him up, but when hee was left to himſelfe, he ſunke, Matth.</hi> 1.4. therefore we muſt have not onely a <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting,</hi> but alſo an <hi>accompliſhing grace,</hi> that may ſtill follow us in our workes: <hi>ne ceſſent in effectum,</hi> that they faile not in the upſhot, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Evangeliſt makes mention, that from him who is full of grace, <hi>We must receive grace for grace, Iohn</hi> 1.14.</p>
                           <p>It was not the grace of God onely, that wrought in Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> ſtirring him up to ho lineſſe: but alſo <hi>gratia Dei,</hi>

                           <p>We deſire that his will may be performed in us, not as in the deepe places, but as in heaven, for this prayer containes two <hi>Sicuts</hi> the one pertaines to God, teaching us how to love him; the other concernes our neighbour, where we pray ſo to be forgiven, as wee forgive our debters: ſo that as heretofore we have noted, <hi>lege ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randi lex ſtatuitur ſupplicandi,</hi> though there were no law to require the love of God, and our neighbour, yet this forme of prayer doth teach us how to love God, and what perfect love wee owe to our neighbour.</p>
                           <p>In the thing it ſelfe, we are to obſerve three points: firſt, a <hi>quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication:</hi> ſecondly, an <hi>Elevation</hi> of the ſoule: thirdly, an <hi>application.</hi>

                           <p>In the <hi>qualification</hi> we are to enquire what is meant by <hi>heaven,</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> either <hi>tanquam continentia,</hi> or elſe we may underſtand them as things contained therein; then how Gods will is done therein.</p>

                                 <item>firſt, the aire where the birds flye, whence they are called <hi>volucres coeli, Matth.</hi> 6.</item>
                                 <item>Secondly, the heaven of heavens, where the Sun, Moone, and Starres are ſet to give light:</item>
                                 <item>thirdly, that which the Apoſtle cals the third heaven, whereunto he was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up, which is the place of bleſſedneſſe, where Gods Majeſty is <hi>eſpecially reſident,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>In all theſe heavens which containe other bodies, in them wee ſhall find that Gods will is done.</p>
                           <p>Of the lower heaven the Prophet ſaith, that it is obedient to Gods will, and fulfills his <hi>word by ſending downe ſnow, and fire, and wind, Pſal.</hi> 148.</p>
                           <p>In the ſecond heaven which <hi>Salomon</hi> calls the <hi>heaven of heavens,</hi> 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.27. Gods will is done, for there at Gods Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the <hi>Sunne and Moone ſtood ſtill, contrary to their uſuall courſe, till the people of God avenged themſelves of their enemies, Joſh.</hi> 10.13.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the earth it ſelfe, and things contained in it, do yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to heaven; for if the heaven be favourable in ſending downe <hi>raine and fruitfull ſeaſons, Act.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. the earth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably will bring forth her encreaſe for the good of man; but <hi>if the heaven be braſſe, the earth alſo will be Iron, Deut.</hi> 28.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, as the powers of the heavens are ſuch, as that they can <hi>draw up clouds from the earth, Pſal.</hi> 13.5. which do diſtill raine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth, to water the Furrowes thereof; ſo we deſire, that the ſpirituall heaven may transforme us into an heauenly nature, not ſetting our minds on earthly things, but on things above.</p>
                           <pb n="83" facs="tcp:48000:333"/>
                           <p>For the things contained in heaven, as they are heavenly; ſo we deſire, that we living on earth, may have our converſation in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: that earthly man, to whom God ſaid, <hi>Terra es, Gen.</hi> 3. may by this meanes be made heavenly.</p>
                           <p>In the third heaven is contained, in reſpect of his humanity, firſt Chriſt himſelfe, who is both in heaven and earth: for as he is called <hi>the head, Epheſ.</hi> 3.23. <hi>of his Church,</hi> he is in Heaven: but in reſpect of his body, which is called <hi>Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. he is on earth. Therefore we pray, that Chriſt on earth, that is, the <hi>Church,</hi> may do Gods will, even as Chriſt the head, who is in heaven, hath done it: that as Chriſt our head came not <hi>to doe his owne will, but the will of him that ſent him, Joh.</hi> 6.38. ſo the whole body of Chriſt may labour to fulfill the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in heaven thus are <hi>Angels, which fulfill his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and hearken to the voyce of his word, Pſal.</hi> 10. So our prayer is, that men, to whom God hath made the promiſe, that they ſhall be <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Luk.</hi> 20. may labour to be like the Angels, in doing Gods will, as they hope to be like them in nature.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, in heaven there is the <hi>Congregation of the firſt borne, Heb.</hi> 12.23. that is, the Saints departed: wherefore our prayer is, that as they have, and ſtill do carefully fulfill Gods will, ſo the Saints on earth, and Church militant, may do the ſame.</p>
                           <p>Againe, whereas Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> out of the 16. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 2. and 19.1. ſaith, that heaven is here upon earth; for when the Pſalmiſt ſaith: <hi>The Heavens declare the glory of God,</hi> the Apoſtle applyeth that to himſelfe and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. of whoſe preaching he ſaith: <hi>No doubt their ſound went out into all Lands, and their words unto the ends of the World:</hi> So that the Apoſtles were heavens living on earth: So our prayer is, that as they living on earth, lived an heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, and began heaven here, ſo our carnall heart may be applyed to the meditation of heaven, that we may be <hi>Saints on earth, Pſ.</hi> 16.</p>
                           <p>The Wiſeman ſaith of the body, <hi>That it being duſt, at the houre of death, turnes it ſelf to duſt, from whence it came, and that the ſpirit returnes to God that gave it, Eccl.</hi> 12.17. Thus muſt the ſpirit returne to God in our life-time, and we muſt, while we be on earth, and <hi>beare the Image of the earthly man,</hi> ſeeke ſtill to be in heaven: and here labour more and more to <hi>beare the Image of the heavenly,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49. As the heavenly part of man, that is, his ſpirit, is willing, and doth not only conſent that <hi>Gods Law is good, but delight in it, Rom.</hi> 7. ſo muſt we be carefull to bring our fleſh in ſubjection, that <hi>our old man, and outward man may conforme himſelfe to the inward and new man,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, touching the queſtion; How Gods will is done in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? the anſwer is, that where his will is both <hi>dulcis,</hi> and <hi>amara vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntas,</hi> a ſweete and a bitter will, it is there obeyed and performed in both kinds: for the heavens do not onely at Gods commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment keepe a continuall motion, which is agreeable to nature, but againſt nature, <hi>Sunne and Moone ſtand ſtill at his will, Joſ.</hi> 10. whoſe obedience tels us, that our duty is to doe his will, not only in things agreeable with our nature, but when his will is contrary to our liking.</p>
                           <pb n="84" facs="tcp:48000:334"/>
                           <p>This obedience was performed in Chriſt: <hi>Not my will, but thine be done, Luk.</hi> 22. and in the Angels, which at Gods commandement are ready not onely to <hi>aſcend,</hi> but alſo to <hi>deſcend, Gen.</hi> 28. to ſhew, that they are content, not onely to appeare in heavenly glory, which is their nature, but alſo to be abaſed, according to the Apoſtles rule, <hi>I can abound, and I can want, Phil.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>The heavenly bodies do ſervice to all Nations, and the <hi>Angels are miniſtring ſpirits, Heb.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>As naturally they have a deſire to aſcend to beare rule, ſo at Gods commandement they are content to deſcend, to do ſervice here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, they do <hi>altogether fulfill Gods will, Pſal.</hi> 104. whereas the nature of man doth hardly grant to obey Gods will, in that which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrange to fleſh and blood, as <hi>Agrippa</hi> affirmeth of himſelfe, <hi>Thou ſomewhat perſwadeſt mee, Act.</hi> 26.25.</p>
                           <p>The Saints in heaven confeſſe to God: <hi>Thou haſt created all things, and for thy wils ſake, they are, and were created, Rev.</hi> 4.11. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſe not to ſubject their will to the will of God, be it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to them or not: but as our Saviour ſpeaketh, Yee ſeeke mee, not <hi>becauſe ye ſaw the miracles, but for that ye did eate of the loaves and were filled, Joh.</hi> 6.26. So if we do that which God requireth, it is rather for our owne ſake, with regard to our owne private profit, then to do Gods will.</p>
                           <p>The heavenly Angels do Gods will with willingneſſe, and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of mind, which is the fat of their ſacrifice: and therefore they are ſaid to have every one <hi>ſixe wings, Eſay</hi> 6. From whoſe example wee muſt learne to do all things commanded of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>murmuring or diſputing, Phil.</hi> 2.14. and that becauſe it is Gods will we ſhould do it.</p>
                           <p>In earth when God willeth any thing, that is not pleaſant to our wils, we make excuſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14. or we poſt it off to others, as <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>John, Joh.</hi> 21. <hi>Quid autem hic?</hi> We are ready to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with <hi>fleſh and blood, Gal.</hi> 3.16. and to ſay with the Diſciples: <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus eſt hic ſermo,</hi> this is a hard ſpeech, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. If we cannot ſhift it off from our ſelves, yet as the Devill reaſoned; <hi>Cur veniſti ante tempus? Matth.</hi> 18.29. and as the people ſay, <hi>It is not time yet to build the houſe of the Lord, Hagg.</hi> 1.5. So we are ready to deferre and prolong the doing of Gods will, as much as may be, when we do it, as the uncleane ſpirit would not come out of the child, but with <hi>much crying, and renting of him, Mark.</hi> 9.26. ſo we cannot do Gods will, but with great murmuring, and grudging; and when men do Gods will in this ſort, they do it not as it is done in heaven by the Angels and Saints, that willingly obey it: but as the Devills in hell, which againſt their wills are faine to do it. Therefore our rule in this behalfe is, that we do Gods will, not <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Elevation,</hi> it is true, that the <hi>qualification</hi> is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, and our prayer is, that we may do Gods will as it is done in heaven, but not as much, with like readineſſe of mind, but
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48000:334"/>not in like meaſure: (for that is impoſſible for earthly men) wee deſire to fulfill Gods will in the manner, but not in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of obedience, which may be expreſſed by the words <hi>Image and likeneſſe, Gen.</hi> 1. Our obedience may be the <hi>likeneſſe</hi> of the Angels; but not the <hi>Image.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The <hi>Character</hi> or <hi>Stampe</hi> of the Angels obedience, is that which is equall in proportion; but ſuch obedience is not to be found; there may be a beame of it, anſwerable in likeneſſe and quality, not in quantity; ſo in likeneſſe we are, <hi>Conformes imagine Chriſti, Rom.</hi> 8. <hi>and beare the image of the heavenly Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. as endeavouring thereunto, but yet we cannot attaine to it.</p>
                           <p>But albeit, it is hard for fleſh and blood, which our Saviour requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: <hi>Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect, Matth.</hi> 5. yet there is an uſe of ſuch precepts: firſt, <hi>ut feramur ad perfectionem,</hi> that we may be <hi>led on to perfection, Heb.</hi> 6.1. Secondly, we muſt have an <hi>Heroicall and free ſpirit, Pſal.</hi> 51. which may ſtirre us up to wiſh that wee could do more then we can, which conſiſts of <hi>Aſpiration,</hi> and <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</hi> We muſt aſpire to the greateſt perfection, with <hi>David: Concupivit anima mea, My ſoule hath luſted to keepe thy righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for ever, Pſal.</hi> 119.20. And, <hi>O that my waies were ſo directed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal.</hi> 119.5.</p>
                           <p>This is an Angelicall perfection, which we cannot attaine unto in this life: therefore we muſt <hi>ſuſpirare,</hi> when we conſider that the Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not luſt,</hi> and yet find that wee do luſt, we are to ſigh and ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Who ſhall deliver us from this body of death? Rom.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>If we find that we cannot love our God with all our heart, and ſoule, as we ought, then to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Vae mihi, quia pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longatus eſt incolatus meus in terra! Wo is me that my dwelling is prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the Tents of Kedar, Pſal.</hi> 120.5.</p>
                           <p>We muſt deſire to do more then we can, and grieve that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do ſo much as we ought; that as we do what we can, ſo what we cannot do, we ſhould ſupply it, <hi>Voto, deſiderio, animo,</hi> with our hearty wiſh, deſire, and mind.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the ſupplication is of two ſorts, <hi>Reall,</hi> and <hi>perſonall:</hi> Touching the firſt, as the grace of God is <hi>multiformis gratia,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. So the will of God being one, is of many ſorts and containeth divers particulars: therefore, as we generally pray that the will of God may be done, ſo when by the word of God wee underſtand, what is the will of God in particular, we are to deſire, no leſſe, that it may be performed: <hi>This is the will of God, even your ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4. Therefore our deſire muſt be, that this will of his may be done and fulfilled in us. This is a ſpeciall remedy againſt the te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ptations of the fleſh, which oppoſe themſelves againſt Gods will.</p>
                           <p>There is another will of God for patience, for he would have us ſuffer for Chriſts ſake, without murmuring, that ſo <hi>wee may ſtop the mouthes of ignorant men,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.6. Therefore we are to pray, that this will of God alſo may be done in us.</p>
                           <p>As <hi>Joſeph</hi> was carefull to do Gods will, touching ſanctification,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48000:335"/>and <hi>Job</hi> to obey Gods will in ſuffering patiently; both which are now Saints in Heaven; ſo muſt wee after their examples be both holy, and carefull and patient.</p>
                           <p>It may be we are willing to obey Gods will in particular, but we will ſay, <hi>Nondum venit hora,</hi> it is not yet time; Therefore we muſt learne to practiſe the Prophets reſolution, <hi>I made haſt, and prolonged not the time to keepe thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>When God revealeth his will to us, we muſt preſently put it in practiſe, and as <hi>Saul</hi> did, <hi>Act.</hi> 9. and not counſell with fleſh and blood, and this is the reall application.</p>
                           <p>The perſons to whom the doing of Gods will is to be applyed, are not onely the whole earth (which is alſo to be wiſhed, as the Prophet ſheweth) <hi>Set up thy ſelfe, O God, above the heaven, and thy glory above all the earth, Pſal.</hi> 57. But the earth or land wherein we dwell (as the Prophet ſpeakes) <hi>that glory may dwell, interra noſtra, in our land, Pſ.</hi> 85. So we pray that Gods will may be done in all lands, but eſpecially in our land, and country, that ſo he may beſtow his bleſſings upon it, but yet we are every one of us particularly to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to our ſelves, for to man it was ſaid by God, <hi>Terra es, Gen.</hi> 3. To man it was ſaid, <hi>Earth, earth, earth, heare the word of the Lord, Jer.</hi> 22. So we deſire that Gods will may eſpecially be done, and fulfilled, in that part of the earth, whereof God hath made us, that is, that in theſe our earthly veſſels, which we carry about with us, we may be carefull to do that, which God requireth at our hands.</p>

The ſecond is the Petition of <hi>Grace,</hi> and of <hi>Gods righteouſneſſe,</hi> wherein we pray that Gods will may be done. The third Petition tendeth to this end, that as the Prophet ſpeakes, God would not with-hold any temporall bleſſing, needfull for this life; but that he would give us all things that are neceſſary for us.</p>

The ſame occaſion moved <hi>Iſaac, to goe downe to Abimelech at Gerar, Gen.</hi> 26. and <hi>Jacob</hi> to relieve his family in the great dearth at this time, was faine to ſend his ſonnes, the Patriarchs, <hi>into Egypt to buy corne, Gen.</hi> 42. The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſraell, when they wanted bread or water, <hi>murmured againſt God and his ſervants, Exod.</hi> 16. <hi>Numb.</hi> 20. the Diſciples of our Saviour were ſo troubled in mind, becauſe they had <hi>forgotten to take bread with them;</hi> that they underſtood not their Maſter, when he gave them warning to <hi>beware of the leven of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Matth.</hi> 8. So the want of outward things, doth diſtract our Saviour were ſo troubled in mind, becauſe they had <hi>forgotten to take bread with them;</hi> that they underſtood not their Maſter, when he gave them warning to <hi>beware of the leven of the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees, Matth.</hi> 8. So the want of outward things, doth diſtract our minds, and makes us unfit for Gods ſervice.</p>
                           <p>Therefore that we may in quietneſſe of mind, intend thoſe things that goe before in his prayer: our Saviour hath indited us a forme of prayer, to ſue to God, as well for things <hi>temporall,</hi> as <hi>ſpirituall,</hi> and <hi>eternall:</hi> for it is lawfull for us to pray for them, ſo that we do it in order.</p>
                           <p>The firſt Petition that the naturall man makes, is <hi>for his daily bread,</hi> but our care muſt be firſt for <hi>the Kingdome of God,</hi> next for the <hi>fulfilling of Gods will</hi> and doing that righteouſneſſe which <hi>God</hi> requires at our hands: and after, wee may in the third place pray for ſuch things as we ſtand in need of during our life.</p>
                           <p>This bleſſing the Fathers obſerve out of the bleſſings which <hi>Iſaac</hi> pronounced upon his ſonnes; <hi>Jacobs</hi> bleſſing was firſt the dew of heaven, and then the fat of the earth, ſhewing that the godly do preferre heavenly comforts before earthly. <hi>Eſaus</hi> bleſſing was, firſt the fatneſſe of the earth, and next the dew of heaven, to teach us, that prophane perſons do make more reckoning of <hi>earthly commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities,</hi> then of <hi>heavenly comforts, Gen.</hi> 27.28. and 39.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in regard of the Spirituall account we are to make of Gods Kingdome, and the doing of his will; we are to wiſh them in the firſt place, and then <hi>Davids Unam petii à Domino, One thing I have required of the Lord, Pſal.</hi> 27. And that which Chriſt ſaith to <hi>Martha, Unam eſt neceſſarium, one thing is needfull, Luk.</hi> 10. would bring us to <hi>Salomons</hi> two things, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. <hi>Give mee not poverty, nor riches; but feed mee with food convenient for mee; leſt being full, I deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? or beeing poore, I ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine.</hi> And that is it which wee are bold to do, by Chriſts owne warrant; for he hath taught us firſt to pray for his <hi>Kingdome,</hi> then for the working of <hi>righteouſneſſe,</hi> or for the doing of Gods will, and laſtly, for <hi>daily bread.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If we do firſt pray for the two former, then we may be bold in
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48000:336"/>the third place to ſue to God for the latter, for he hath promiſed to with-hold no good thing from them that lead a godly life; if the doing of Gods will be our meat, then, <hi>Requiem dedit timentibus ſe, He hath given reſt to them that feare him, Pſal.</hi> 111.</p>
                           <p>In the Petition we are to obſerve from ſixe words, ſixe ſeverall points:
<list>
                                 <item>firſt, the thing that we deſire, that is, <hi>bread:</hi>
                                 </item>
                                 <item>ſecondly, the attribute, <hi>our bread:</hi>
                                 </item>
                                 <item>thirdly, <hi>daily bread:</hi>

                                 <item>fourthly, wee deſire that this bread may be <hi>given</hi> us:</item>

                                 <item>ſixthly <hi>hodie,</hi> and as long as we ſay <hi>hodie, to day, Heb.</hi> 3.</item>
                              </list>
                           </p>
                           <p>To beginne with giving: hitherto the tenor of this prayer ran in the third perſon, now we are to pray in the ſecond, ſaying: <hi>Da tu,</hi> whereupon the Church hath grounded a double dialect of prayer, which comes all to one effect; for that which the Church prayeth for, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 67. <hi>God be mercifull unto us, and bleſſe us,</hi> is no leſſe a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, then if we ſhould ſay, in the ſecond perſon, <hi>Miſerere noſtri, O Lord be mercifull to us: and bleſſe us,</hi> and that which is added, <hi>and lift up his countenance,</hi> is all one, as if the Church, ſpeaking to God, ſhould ſay, <hi>Lift up the light of thy countenance.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This change, or alteration of perſon, proceedeth from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, which the Saints are to gather to themſelves, in prayer: for having prayed for the ſanctifying of Gods name, for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of his Kingdome, and for grace and ability to do his will, Chriſt aſſureth us, that we may be bold to ſpeake to God for our owne wants.</p>
                           <p>Out of the word of <hi>Giving,</hi> we are to note three things: firſt, <hi>our owne want;</hi> for if we had it of our ſelves, we would not crave it of God: this confeſſion of our want, and indigence, is a great glory to God, that all the inhabitants of the earth <hi>uſque ad Regem Davidem,</hi> to profeſſe to ſay, <hi>Give us, Pſal.</hi> 40. <hi>I am poore and needy but the Lord careth for mee;</hi> they do profeſſe themſelves to be his beggers, not onely by the voyce of nature, which they utter for outward things, as other unreaſonable creatures do, but by thoſe prayers, which they make for the ſupply of grace, whereby they may be enabled to do Gods will, ſo that not onely <hi>regnum tuum</hi> is Gods gift, but alſo <hi>panem noſtrum,</hi> we acknowledge to be his gift. It is from God from whom we receive all things, as well <hi>the good givings as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gifts, Jam.</hi> 1.17. he is the author, not onely of <hi>bleſsings ſpirituall,</hi> but of <hi>benefits temporall;</hi> he gives us not onely <hi>grace</hi> to obey his will, but as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>dat eſcam, Pſal.</hi> 104.</p>
                           <p>The idolatrous people ſay of their Idols, I will goe after my lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that give mee my bread, and my water, my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>oyle, and my wine, but God ſaith after, <hi>It is I that gave her corne, and it is my wine, and my flaxe, and my oyle, Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>Ipſe dat ſemen ſementi, &amp; panem manducanti,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.10. We are deſtitute of the meaneſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings that are; it is God onely from whom wee receive all things, therefore to him we pray, acknowledging our owne want, <hi>Da no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis panem.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, we muſt conſider the word <hi>Da,</hi> as it is ſet in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Veniat,</hi> or <hi>habeam panem,</hi> it muſt not content us that we have,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48000:337"/>bread, but labour that we may have it of Gods gift; <hi>Eſau</hi> ſaid of things temporall which he enjoyed, <hi>I have enough, Gen.</hi> 33. not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging from whom: <hi>Balaam</hi> cared not how he came by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion, ſo he had it, and therefore he is ſaid <hi>to have loved the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of unrighteouſneſſe,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. but we muſt labour, not ſo much to <hi>have good things,</hi> as to <hi>have them from God:</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> is to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that the power which he hath, <hi>was given him from above, Joh.</hi> 19. and not to vaunt of any uſurped power.</p>
                           <p>It is ſaid of God, <hi>Tu aperis manum tuam, Pſal.</hi> 104. <hi>Thou openeſt the doores of heaven, Pſal.</hi> 78. So we are not ſo much to labour for temporall things by our owne endeavour, as that we may have them from God.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Da,</hi> oppoſed to rendring, teacheth us, that it is not of our owne endeavour, but it is of Gods free bounty and liberality, that we have bread, and other things: which while wee ſeeke for of Gods gift; we confeſſe that to be true which <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non eſt panis ſapientis, Be a man never ſo wiſe, yet he hath not alwayes to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply his need, Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. As he that is higheſt gets not alwaies the goale, nor the ſtrongeſt man the victory: ſo ſaith our Saviour, <hi>Which of you by taking thought can adde one cubit to his ſtature? Matth.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>All our endeavours for the things of this life, are unprofitable, without Gods bleſſing; <hi>It is in vaine to riſe up early, and to go to bed late, Pſal.</hi> 127.</p>
                           <p>And when he <hi>bleſſeth our labour,</hi> then he is ſaid to <hi>give us bread;</hi> and therefore we are to confeſſe with <hi>David,</hi> that <hi>whatſoever we have received, we have received it at his hands,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.14.</p>
                           <p>Now the meanes of Gods giving, is of foure ſorts: Firſt, God giveth bread when hee bleſſeth the earth with plenty; when hee gives force to the heaven: <hi>When the heaven heareth the earth, the earth heareth the Corne, the Wine, the Oyle, and they heare man, Hoſ.</hi> 2.21.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, he gives, when hee ſets us in ſome honeſt trade of life, and vouchſafeth his bleſſing to our endeavours therein, that we may get our living, and <hi>eate the labour of our hands, Pſal.</hi> 128. without which the firſt giving will do us no good.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, he gives us bread, not onely in his bleſſing the earth with increaſe, and by bleſſing our honeſt paines in our vocation, but when he gives us <hi>Baculum panis,</hi> the ſtaffe of bread; for at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure he uſeth <hi>to breake the ſtaffe of bread, Levit.</hi> 26. and to make it of no power to nouriſh us: then are they but beggerly elements, <hi>When we eat and have not enough, Hag.</hi> 1. Therefore our prayer is, that he would cauſe the earth to yeeld us bread, ſo that to the bread he would infuſe a force, to <hi>ſtrengthen mans heart,</hi> for which end it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaies, <hi>Man lives not by bread onely, but by the Word of God:</hi> therefore we pray, that as our bread by his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, is made to us, <hi>panis ſalubris,</hi> ſo it may be <hi>panis ſanctus, Deut.</hi> 8. that he will give us grace to uſe his creatures to the end that wee
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48000:337"/>may the better ſerve him; otherwiſe, howſoever they nouriſh our bodies, yet they will prove poyſon to our ſoules.</p>
                           <p>God performeth theſe three former givings to the Heathen, ſo that their bellies are full with bread, but withall <hi>hee ſendeth leanneſſe into their ſoules, Pſal.</hi> 106. But Chriſtian men have, not onely the earth to yeeld her fruit, Gods bleſſing being upon their labours, and a bleſſing upon the creature it ſelfe, that it is not in vaine, but nouriſheth; but alſo it is ſanctified to them, and that bread is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly theirs, becauſe they are Gods children, <hi>Et panis eſt filiorum,</hi> it is the childrens bread.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, the thing we deſire to be given, is <hi>Bread,</hi> concerning which, becauſe the decayes and defects of our nature are many, ſo as it were infinite to expreſſe then ſeverally, therefore our Saviour Chriſt doth here comprehend them all under the terme of <hi>Bread,</hi> uſing the ſame figure which God himſelfe uſeth in the law, where under one word, many things are contained.</p>
                           <p>Howſoever our wants be many, yet the heathen bring them all to theſe two <hi>Pabulum, &amp; latibulum, food and covering:</hi> and as they do, ſo doth not onely <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Law, where all that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to this life, is referred to <hi>victum,</hi> and <hi>amictum, Deut.</hi> 10.18. but alſo Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Epiſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Hebentes victum &amp; amictum, his contenti ſumus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So then, under this petition is contained, not onely that God would give us bread, by cauſing the earth to bring forth corne, and all good ſeaſons for that purpoſe, but that withall he will give us <hi>health of body,</hi> and not plague us with ſickneſſe, as hee did the Iſraelites, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31. Then, that we may have peace, without which theſe outward bleſſings will afford us no comfort: and that as he fills our bellies with food, ſo he will give us <hi>Laetitiam cordis, Act.</hi> 14.17. that is, all manner of contentment in this life.</p>
                           <p>Howbeit this petition ſtayeth not here, for the prayer of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an men muſt differ from the Lyons roaring, and the Ravens cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: the end of their praying is, that their bellies may be filled: but we muſt have as great a care for the food of our ſoules: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where we call it <hi>panem noſtrum,</hi> we do not meane <hi>panem commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> ſuch bread as is common to us with other creatures, but that <hi>Spirituall bread,</hi> which is proper to men, which conſiſts not only of body, but of ſoule and body, which muſt be both fed: and where we pray that God would give <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, we aske ſuch bread as is apt and meete for our ſuſtenance: that is, not onely <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but <hi>Heavenly Bread,</hi> becauſe we conſiſt not onely of a terreſtriall, but alſo of a celeſtiall ſubſtance: ſo then our deſire is, that God would give us, not onely, <hi>panem jumentorum,</hi> but <hi>panem Angelorum, Pſal.</hi> 78. <hi>The bread of Angels;</hi> and our ſuit is as well for <hi>panis coeli, Joh.</hi> 6. as for earthly bread.</p>
                           <p>The bread of the ſoule is Gods word, which hath a great refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to earthly bread: and therefore ſpeaking of the ſweetneſſe of that bread, <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>I eſteemed of the words of his mouth, more than my appointed food, Job,</hi> 23. and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thy word is
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48000:338"/>ſweeter then hony, and the hony combe, Pſalm.</hi> 19.10.</p>
                           <p>In the New Teſtament the Apoſtle, to ſhew the nouriſhing force of Gods word, ſaith, that <hi>Timothy</hi> was <hi>enutritus verbis fidei,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6. To ſhew the taſte or reliſh that it hath as well as naturall food, ſaith, <hi>Guſtaverit bonum Deiverbum, hath taſted the good word of God, Heb.</hi> 6. So the food of the ſoule is to be deſired at Gods hands as well as the bodily food.</p>
                           <p>There is a <hi>Famin as well of Gods word, as of bread, Amos</hi> 8. There is an <hi>hungring &amp; thirſting after righteouſneſſe, Matth.</hi> 5. therefore wee are to pray, that God would ſupply the wants, not onely of the body, but of the ſoule likewiſe.</p>
                           <p>But there is a Spirituall food, both for Body and Soule, that which our Saviour promiſeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>He that commeth to mee ſhall not hunger, and he that beleeveth in mee, ſhall never thirſt:</hi> that is the hidden <hi>Manna</hi> that God hath promiſed for us in heaven; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it was ſaid: <hi>Bleſſed is he that eateth bread in the Kingdome of God, Luk.</hi> 14.</p>
                           <p>Thus, by how much the leanneſſe of the ſoule is worſe then bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily famine, ſo much the more earneſtly are we to pray for the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food, then for the food of the body.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, for the firſt attribute, we pray not ſimply for <hi>Bread,</hi> but for <hi>our Bread.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The word <hi>Our,</hi> hath reſpect not onely to <hi>Uſe,</hi> but to <hi>Property</hi> and right.</p>
                           <p>This right or property is double: Firſt, that which was appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the beginning: <hi>In ſudore vultus tui comedes panem tuum,</hi> Our requeſt to God is for that food, which is gotten by honeſt paines taken in our calling, whereunto God hath made a promiſe, <hi>Thou ſhalt eate the labour of thy hands, Pſalm.</hi> 128. And without which we have no right to this bodily food: For 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Qui non laborat, non manducet: He that laboureth not, let him not eate.</hi> Now we would have <hi>God</hi> ſupply our wants with bread by right, and this right is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall to all adventurers.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, as we would have it made <hi>Ours,</hi> by the labour of our vocation, ſo by the duty of invocation, that this corporall food, which is common to other creatures, may be <hi>proper to us</hi> by calling upon God for his bleſſing upon it, which if we do, we have a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, it ſhall be <hi>truly ours. Open thy mouth, I will fill it, Pſal.</hi> 81.11. For, <hi>the creatures of God are ſanctified to us by the Word of God and prayer,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>This puts a difference betwixt the Chriſtian mans bread, and that which the prophane man eates: for firſt, thoſe ſlouthfull per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom the Apoſtle calls <hi>ſlow-bellies, Tit.</hi> 1.12. cannot ſay this prayer as they ought: for they are nothing but idle upon the earth, and <hi>Fruges conſumere nati,</hi> borne to eate and drinke: they labour not for their living, but eate <hi>panem alienum,</hi> not <hi>ſuum;</hi> which the Apoſtle requires, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.12.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>thoſe that eate the bread of violence, Prov.</hi> 4.17. and feed upon bread, that is gotten by deceit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17. do not
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48000:338"/>eate <hi>panem ſuum,</hi> but <hi>ſubdititium:</hi> they eate not <hi>panem datum à Deo,</hi> but <hi>a Daemone.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, <hi>Eſau having filled his belly, roſe without giving God thankes after he had eate, as without calling upon God for his bleſsing before, Gen.</hi> 25. For the which alſo he is ſaid to be <hi>prophane, Heb.</hi> 12. So are all thoſe that eate of Gods creatures, without praying to him for his bleſſing, and for a ſanctified uſe of them; which thing if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do, as <hi>Atheiſts,</hi> and prophane perſons, their bread may be <hi>panis ſalubris,</hi> but not <hi>ſanctus,</hi> it may <hi>be able to nouriſh their bodies,</hi> but it ſhall bring <hi>leanneſſe to their ſoules.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the other attribute of bread, is <hi>Daily,</hi> concerning which we muſt conſider foure things.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, from the Latine word <hi>quotidianum,</hi> which hath relation to the time; by which word, as we acknowledge our daily want, and Gods continuall care and providence for the ſupply thereof, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Thou giveſt meat in due ſeaſon, Pſal.</hi> 104. So Chriſt teacheth us daily to praiſe and magnifie Gods care, daily extended towards us, and to uſe that <hi>Pſalme</hi> of thankſgiving, wherein the Church confeſſeth Gods goodneſſe in that behalfe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Greeke</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">

                           </p>
                           <p>Now, for as much as man conſiſts of <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soule,</hi> his prayer to God muſt not be onely for ſuch meat as is meete to nouriſh the <hi>Body,</hi> but alſo for the food which agreeth with the <hi>Soule:</hi> for it is in vaine to have food, except it be nutritive, and convenient for us.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Syriack</hi> word uſed by our Saviour ſignifieth <hi>panem neceſsitatis meae,</hi> which hath relation to the <hi>quaility of the bread,</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching us not to pray for <hi>Dainty meat,</hi> but ſuch as is fit to relieve our hunger: <hi>Tribue victui meo neceſſaria:</hi> not meat which is above my eſtate: <hi>Da panem neceſsitatis, non laſciviae,</hi> bread of neceſſity, not wantonneſſe.</p>
                           <p>The Iſraelites luſted after the Fleſh-pots of Egypt: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>God gave them quailes from heaven, but</hi> (which was the heavie judgement of God upon them) <hi>they periſhed while the meat was in their mouthes, Pſal.</hi> 78.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle willeth us therefore, not to ſet our minds upon <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penfluity:</hi> but contrarily, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>Food and Rayment,</hi> let us therewith be content.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the Hebrew word uſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. hath relation to the <hi>quantity:</hi> for it ſignifieth <hi>panem dimenſi mei, non gulae;</hi> and it tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth us not to ſeeke abundance, but to deſire of God to meaſure us out ſo much as he knoweth to be meet for us, and as Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, to <hi>give us our portion of meat in due ſeaſon, Luk.</hi> 12.22. For the Scripture telleth us what inconvenience commeth of abundance of meat: <hi>Dilectus meus impinguatus recalcitravit, Deut.</hi> 32.15. <hi>My be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved when he waxed fat, ſpurned with his heele;</hi> and the ſinne of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi> was <hi>fulneſſe of bread, Ezek.</hi> 16. and the people by <hi>exceſsive eating and drinking of wine, made themſelves ſicke, Hoſ.</hi> 7.5. Therefore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48000:339"/>Chriſt diligently warneth his diſciples to take heed of ſurfetting and drunkenneſſe for this cauſe: <hi>Ne graventur corda, That your hearts waxe not heavie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Fifthly, in the word <hi>Nobis</hi> we muſt conſider two things: Firſt, a <hi>Reaſon:</hi> ſecondly, a <hi>Limitation:</hi> For the firſt, we deſire that this bread ſhould be <hi>given us.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Firſt, becauſe we are Gods creatures, he refuſeth not to heare the <hi>Lyons and Ravens in this behalfe, when they cry to him.</hi> And our Saviour ſaith, that <hi>our heavenly Father feedeth the fowles of the aire, Matth.</hi> 6.26. And therefore wee, in regard we are his creatures, as well as they, we may by right make this prayer to him.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in as much as we are men, we may be bold to crave that favour at his hands which he ſheweth indifferently to all men: for he ſuffereth the <hi>Sunne to ſhine on the evill, and on the good, Matth.</hi> 5. And as <hi>David</hi> ſaith: <hi>Oculi omnium ſuſpiciunt in te, The eyes of all wait and looke up to thee, Pſal.</hi> 145. Therefore we are to pray, that God will give bread, not onely <hi>nobis animalibus,</hi> but <hi>nobis hominibus,</hi> not onely as to <hi>living creatures,</hi> but as to <hi>Men.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the Gentiles and Heathen people, which <hi>onely ſeeke after theſe things, Matth.</hi> 6. do obtaine them at Gods hands; much more will God grant them to us, which profeſſe our ſelves Chriſtians, and his Children.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, for the <hi>Limitation,</hi> it is not <hi>mihi, non meum,</hi> but <hi>give us,</hi> and <hi>give our:</hi> the reaſon is, that as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.6. Our wels may flow out abroad, and that there may be rivers of waters in the ſtreetes, and that not only we may not be burdenſome to others, but that <hi>we may have to give to them that have need, Eph.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, for the word <hi>Hodie,</hi> our Saviour teacheth us to pray, <hi>Give us bread this day,</hi> and as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. <hi>Dum dicitur ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe life is but onely <hi>dies,</hi> not <hi>ſeculum.</hi> And the Wiſe man ſaith: <hi>Talke not of to morrow, for thou knoweſt not what a day may bring forth.</hi> We may not ſay to our ſoule: <hi>Soule, thou haſt ſtore of goods laid up for many yeares.</hi> We ſee by his example what may fall out, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12. For as much as the continuance of our life is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, our deſire muſt be, that God would give us ſufficient for our preſent want.</p>
                           <p>Howbeit this makes not for them that are careleſſe for the time to come: for ſuch are ſent to <hi>learne wiſedome of the Ant, Prov.</hi> 30. which provides for Winter: and not onely the Saints at all times, have beene carefull and provident for outward things, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> who counſelled <hi>Paraoh</hi> before hand <hi>to lay up corne to feed him for ſeven yeares ſpace during the famine, Gen.</hi> 41. But our Saviour himſelfe gives charge, <hi>that that which remaineth ſhould be ſaved, and nothing loſt, Joh.</hi> 6. And it was his pleaſure that <hi>Judas</hi> ſhould beare the bagge, for his and their proviſion, to teach us, that he alloweth provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care for things earthly.</p>
                           <p>But by this word <hi>daily</hi> our Saviour condemneth <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                           <p>Here ariſeth an objection, how a man having filled his belly, or being ready to leave this world, may ſay this prayer. The anſwer is, firſt, <hi>Multi dormierunt divites qui ſurrexerunt pauperes:</hi> therefore our deſire is, that as we have enough now, ſo we may be preſerved in this eſtate, and that God would not change plenty into poverty. Againe, though wee have bread, and it continue with us, yet it is nothing without that <hi>beata pax;</hi> therefore though we have the thing it ſelfe, yet we are to deſire that which is the <hi>life of bread,</hi> which is a <hi>power to nouriſh;</hi> then, that God will give us the <hi>ſanctified bread,</hi> which is the heavenly Manna, and grace, that as we worke for bread in our vocations, ſo we remember to ſanctifie it by <hi>invocation;</hi> for elſe it is <hi>uſurped bread.</hi>

Prayer, is a meanes not onely <hi>to draw all grace from God, Prov.</hi> 12.2. but it is <hi>obex mali, &amp; fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellum daemonis:</hi> as the name of Chriſt is <hi>Oleum effuſum, Cant.</hi> 1. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe by it we receive all good; ſo the name of the Lord is <hi>Turris fortiſſima, Prov.</hi> 18. for that it ſaves and defends us from all evill.</p>
                           <p>As theſe are both truely affirmed of Gods name; ſo by the Invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the name of God, we have this double benefit, that wee doe not onely receive all good by it, but alſo are delivered from all evill.</p>
                           <p>In the three former Petitions, our Saviour hath taught us to draw grace from God; in theſe three latter we are taught to uſe that kinde of prayer that concernes the removing of all evill, called <hi>Tekinah,</hi>

                           <p>The evill is of three ſorts, of <hi>ſinnes paſt,</hi> and <hi>to come,</hi> and of the <hi>evill of puniſhment.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the firſt of theſe three Petitions, we pray againſt the <hi>guilt of ſinnes paſt,</hi> that God would not charge us with them: in the ſecond, againſt the <hi>running iſſue of ſinne to come,</hi> that God would not ſuffer us to ſinne hereafter: in the third, that God would turne away from us all thoſe plagues that our ſinnes deſerve, both in this life, and in the life to come, and theſe three Petitions are fitly oppoſed to the three former.</p>
                           <p>To the <hi>Kingdome of glory</hi> we oppoſe our <hi>ſinnes:</hi> to the <hi>doing of Gods will, temptation:</hi> to <hi>naturall good things,</hi> the <hi>evill of the world to come:</hi> and the miſeries of this life; from both which we deſire to be delivered, when we ſay, <hi>deliver us from evill.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Petition conſiſts of <hi>debts,</hi> and <hi>forgiveneſſe,</hi> but before we han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle them, we are to ſpeake, firſt, of the neceſſity of this Petition: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, of the goodneſſe of God that penneth the Petition for us.</p>
                           <pb n="97" facs="tcp:48000:340"/>
                           <p>What need we have to pray to God for remiſſion of our ſinnes, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares hereby, becauſe <hi>our ſinnes do make a partition betweene God and us, Eſa.</hi> 59. the effect whereof is, that our miſ-deeds doe <hi>turne Gods bleſsings from us, and doe keepe good things from us, Ier.</hi> 5.25.</p>
                           <p>Now having already deſired at Gods hands the <hi>glory of Gods King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> the <hi>good of grace,</hi> for the doing of his will, and all <hi>outward good things</hi> neceſſary for this life: we are of neceſſity to pray that God will <hi>forgive us our ſinnes,</hi> which otherwiſe will hinder us of theſe good things: and as our ſinnes doe hinder Gods graces that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come to us; ſo they hinder our prayers, that they cannot come to God, for our ſinnes are as it were <hi>a cloud to hide God, ſo that our prayers cannot goe through, Lam.</hi> 3.44. So that except we deſire the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of our ſinnes, we ſhall in vaine pray for the three former good things.</p>
                           <p>Beſides, our ſinnes are a plaine hinderance to Gods Kingdome, for none ſhall come thither, but <hi>ſuch as are uncorrupt,</hi> and voide of ſinnes in the whole courſe of their life, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. <hi>Et nihil impurum ingreditur ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>Secondly, the goodneſſe of God appeareth herein that he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited us a prayer to aske remiſſion, telling us that it is poſſible to obtaine remiſſion of ſinne. It is true, that by our ſinnes, wee have made our ſelves uncapable of all good things, but yet we ſee the goodneſſe of God, that as we have ſtill <hi>dona,</hi> ſo he teacheth us to ſay, <hi>condona.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Where he teacheth all men to pray for good things, we learne that we are all <hi>mendici Dei:</hi> but in that we are taught to aske forgiveneſſe of ſinne, we ſee that we are <hi>malefici Dei,</hi> the <hi>malefactors of God,</hi> ſuch as have need of pardon: and the goodneſſe of God towards us appeares to be the greater in this behalfe, becauſe there is no Angell nor ſpirit to whom he vouchſafeth this favour, to have their ſinnes remitted, ſave onely to man.</p>
                           <p>Of them it is ſaid, <hi>he found no truth in his Angels, in his ſervants, and in his Angels there were folly, Iob</hi> 4.18. that is, they had treſpaſſes, but yet God will not forgive them, nor receive any ſupplication for pride; but contrarywiſe, <hi>he keepeth the Angels that ſinned in everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting chaines to the judgement of the great day,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. <hi>he that is the God of the ſpirits of all fleſh, Numb.</hi> 27.16. <hi>&amp;</hi> 16.22. will not heare the ſpirits that ſinned againſt him: but <hi>thou that heareſt prayers, to thee ſhall all fleſh come, Pſal.</hi> 65.</p>
                           <p>There is a way for man to eſcape the danger of ſinne, if he aske par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don: but the ſinnes of the wicked Angels ſhall not be forgiven. The elect Angels doe make the three firſt Petitions as well as we; and the Petition for the ſupply of natural defects is common to all living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, but this which prayeth for pardon of ſinnes is proper onely to man; ſo we ſee how God exerciſeth his goodneſſe, and ſheweth it; not onely in exerciſing of liberality to them that have need; but his long ſuffering in pardoning them that have ſinned againſt him.</p>

                           <p>To come to the Petition it ſelfe; by <hi>Debis,</hi> our Saviour meaneth <hi>ſinnes,</hi> expreſſely ſo called <hi>Luke</hi> 11.4. and <hi>ſinners</hi> are called <hi>debters, Luke</hi> 13.4. for the Scripture ſpeakes of them, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.24. one was brought <hi>that owed ten thouſand Talents,</hi> that is, which had committed a great number of ſinnes, and <hi>Luke</hi> 7.31. a lender had two debters, by which are meant ſinners; the reaſon hereof is, becauſe there is a reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance betwixt <hi>ſinnes</hi> and <hi>debts.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>In the affaires of men, the caſe is thus, that if the condition be not performed, they are bound to indure the penalty, and ſo become double indebted: ſo it is betweene God and us, the ſinnes that we commit by the breach of Gods Law, is <hi>Chirographum contra nos, an hand-writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, Col.</hi> 2. So they are called in the old Teſtament, <hi>Thou writeſt heavie or hard things againſt us, Iob</hi> 13.26. and <hi>Ezech.</hi> 2. <hi>Our ſins are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to a book written in both ſides;</hi> for we are bound to keep Gods Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, becauſe he made us, and not onely ſo, but he ſtill doth nouriſh and preſerve us, therefore we ought to doe his will; <hi>hee gives us Talents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Matth.</hi> 25. which wee ought to imploy to his glory; hee gives us dwelling places in the world, as to the Iſraelites, he gave the land of the Heathen, <hi>that they might keepe his Statutes, and obſerve his Lawes, Pſal.</hi> 105. If we fulfill them, we diſcharge our duty to God, and are free from all penalty, but if we doe it not, there is an obligation, <hi>Deut.</hi> 27. <hi>Curſed is every one that continueth not in all things that are written to doe them.</hi> If he place us in the Vineyard, he will looke to receive fruit of it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. If he give us Talents, he will have us ſo to imploy them, as that he may reape gaine thereby, <hi>Luke</hi> 19. The gifts, and graces that God beſtowes upon us, muſt bee imployed in hallowing his name, in enlarging his Kingdome, in accompliſhment of his will; if we fulfill this, the penalty of the Law takes no hold on us, but if we doe not onely not uſe them to his glory, but abuſe them, and turne them to the breach of the Law, by ſerving ſinne, then are we in a double ſort indebted to God, and make our ſelves guilty of his wrath, <hi>Et quis intelligit, &amp;c.</hi> Who <hi>underſtandeth the power of his wrath? Pſal.</hi> 90.</p>
                           <p>If we conſider how grievous plagues God threatned for the breach of the Law, we would be more carefull, and heedfull that we doe not offend him, which becauſe we conſider not, we become indebted to God.</p>
                           <p>We are debters to the fleſh, to provide for it onely, ſo much as is meete for the releeving of it, <hi>Rem.</hi> 8.12. And the reſt of our care muſt be for the ſpirit: but becauſe all our care is for the fleſh, to ſatisfie it, in fulfilling the luſts thereof, and are careleſſe of our ſpirits, therefore we become indebted to God in a third ſort, by breaking his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, in that which concernes our ſelfe, but this the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I am debter to the wiſe, and the unwiſe, Rom.</hi> 1.14. That is, we muſt be carefull of others, as God ſaid to <hi>Caine, Where is thy brother? Gen.</hi> 4. But becauſe <hi>omnes, quae ſua ſunt quaerunt, all ſeeke their owne, Phil.</hi> 2. and ſeeke not the good of others, therefore they grow further indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God.</p>
                           <p>Theſe <hi>debts,</hi> or ſinnes, are properly ſaid to be <hi>ours,</hi> becauſe they
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48000:341"/>proceed from us, (for there is no member of our body that is not guilty of ſome ſinne) and not in that ſenſe, that bread is ſaid to be ours, which commeth to us, and is made ours, by Gods gift; and when wee pray <hi>forgive us our debts,</hi> we learne that it is our duty to crave forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for others, as for our ſelves, for as the Apoſtle by theſe words, <hi>The rebukes of them that rebuked thee, fell upon me, Rom.</hi> 15.5. ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that Chriſt was carried with the ſame zeale againſt ſinne commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God, as if it had beene againſt himſelfe; ſo he teacheth, that we muſt be moved with the like compaſſion towards others, when we conſider their ſinnes, that we find in our ſelves for our owne; and that we ought no leſſe to pray for them, then for our ſelves, and to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer others to paſſe over the bridge of Gods mercie, as well as we.</p>
                           <p>In the words <hi>debts,</hi> three things are to be noted: firſt, where Chriſt teacheth his Apoſtles, that were baptized, and the moſt perfect Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians that ever were, to pray for remiſſion of ſinnes; it ſhould work in our nature an humiliation, for they in making this prayer, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge themſelves ſinners, much more ought we.</p>
                           <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſeth of himſelfe, <hi>Luke</hi> 5.3. <hi>I am a ſinfull man,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelfe, <hi>peccatorum primus ſum ego, I am the chiefe of ſinners,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. Saint <hi>Iames</hi> including himſelfe, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>in multis offendimus omnes, In many things we ſinne all, Iames</hi> 3.2. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſinne, we deceive our ſelves,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.9. He ſaith not <hi>exaltamus nos,</hi> as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſpake of modeſty, or <hi>non humiliamus nos,</hi> wee doe not humble our ſelves: but <hi>decipimus nos,</hi> and <hi>if we deny it, the truth is not in us:</hi> Seeing it is ſo, we muſt not ſay with the Phariſee, <hi>I am not as this man,</hi> but with the Publican, <hi>God be mercifull to me a ſinner, Luke</hi> 18.13.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we are not onely <hi>ſinners,</hi> but <hi>daily ſinners,</hi> as appeareth by this, that vve are taught, no leſſe to pray daily for forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes, then for bread; To confirme this, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Septies in die cadit juſtus, the juſt man fals ſeven times a day, Prov.</hi> 24. and as man eateth and drinketh every day, ſo <hi>he drinkes iniquity like water, Iob</hi> 15.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, vve runne into ſuch debts, as vve are not able to diſcharge: for if vve vvere, vve needed not to ſay, <hi>Dimitte nobis, Forgive us our debts;</hi> but, <hi>Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all, Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>To ſignifie to us the greatneſſe and number of our ſinnes, one vvas brought that ovved 500. pence, and another that ovved 50. <hi>Luke</hi> 7. and another that ovved to his Maſter ten thouſand Talents. By vvhich vve perceive, that vve cannot make ſatisfaction to God, therefore hee muſt remit them.</p>
                           <p>The conſideration vvhereof ought to vvorke in us humiliation: Firſt, that as <hi>Iob</hi> ſayes, our hearts doe not excuſe us, and that vve ſeek not to juſtifie our ſelves, that as God requireth, we <hi>confeſſe our miſ-deeds, Levit.</hi> 26.40. that <hi>we acknowledge our ſinnes to God, and hide them not, Pſal.</hi> 32. For, <hi>if we confeſſe our ſinnes, God is faithfull to forgive our ſins,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that vve doe not onely confeſſe, but <hi>be ſorry for them, Pſal.</hi> 38. that vvhile vve are in danger to God for our ſinnes, vve goe and humble our ſelves, and intreat him, and ſuffer not our eves to
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48000:342"/>ſleepe, till we be ſure how we may obtaine forgiveneſſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6, 3.</p>
                           <p>The conſideration of ſinne made <hi>David forget to eate his bread, Pſal.</hi> 102. ſo greatly was he diſquieted, till he was aſſured of pardon.</p>
                           <p>For the ſecond point, if our ſinnes be debts, they muſt be payed. <hi>Owe nothing to any:</hi> but we are not able to anſwer <hi>one of a thouſand, Iob</hi> 9. and for the penalty of malediction we are not able to endure it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90. <hi>Who knoweth the power of his wrath?</hi> therefore our prayer muſt bee to God, that our miſery may prevaile more with God, to move him to compaſſion, then our unworthineſſe, to ſtirre up his indignation: and that he will <hi>Cancell the hand-writing, Col.</hi> 2. which thing, for that he is <hi>full of the bowels of compaſſion, Ier.</hi> 31.20. hee is moved to doe, when he ſeeth us ſorry for our ſinnes; howbeit his juſtice muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, elſe his mercie cannot take place: but Chriſt by his death ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done that, God ſaith of the ſinner: <hi>Deliver him, for I have received a reconciliation, Iob</hi> 33. <hi>Qui circumciſus eſt, debitor eſt totius legis, Gal.</hi> 5.3. But Chriſt was circumciſed, and therefore fulfilled the law for us, <hi>ad ultimum quadrantem,</hi> to the utmoſt farthing: and not onely ſo, but he ſaith of himſelfe: <hi>Exolvi quae non rapui, I reſtored that which I tooke not, Pſal.</hi> 69.4. He not onely perfectly fulfilled the Law, but ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the curſe of the Law, which he had not deſerved, with this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition: <hi>Sinite iſtos abire, Let theſe goe, Iohn</hi> 18. that is, hee was content to be the reconciliation for us, that he might draw us out of the hands of Gods juſtice.</p>
                           <p>The eſtate of our debts may be compared with the <hi>Widewes ſtate that was left in debt by her husband,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. for as the Lord bleſſed her Oyle in ſuch ſort, as ſhe did not onely pay her debts, but had enough to live on after; ſo Chriſt is our <hi>Oleum effuſum, our Oyle pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out,</hi> that is of power not onely to ſatisfie Gods wrath for ous ſins, but alſo to give us an eſtate in the Kingdome of Heaven, and for his ſake it is that we may be bold to pray for remiſſion of ſinnes, and are taught to beleeve, that for his merits, our ſinnes are forgiven: ſo that is true, <hi>Legem operandi, &amp; legem credendi, lex ſtatuit ſupplicandi,</hi> the Law of prayer ſtabliſhed both the Law of obeying and beleeving.</p>
                           <p>Our of <hi>Dimitie,</hi> ariſe three things for our comfort: Firſt, that even theſe ſinnes which we commit after Baptiſme, after our calling, and when we are come to the knowledge of the truth, are remiſſible.</p>
                           <p>In teaching the Apoſtles to pray, he aſſureth them of this favour, that the ſame party that ſaith <hi>peccata noſtra,</hi> our ſinnes, is taught to ſay, <hi>Pater noſter:</hi> Our Father. Our comfort therefore is, that ſtill we are the children of God, though great ſinners: for though we loſe the dutifull affection of children, yet God cannot loſe, <hi>Viſcera patris,</hi> the tender bowels of a Father.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>David,</hi> to a rebellious ſonne, could not but ſhew a fatherly affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: <hi>Doe good to the young man Abſolon,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.5. So though the prodigall ſonne had offended hainouſly, yet the Father is ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, another comfort, that albeit we commit ſinne daily, yet he will daily forgive us: for God ſhould mocke us, ſaith <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> if bidding us pray for forgiveneſſe, he ſhould for all that ſhut up the
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48000:342"/>bowels of his mercie: he bids us pray for pardon of our ſinnes, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no difference, whether they be peny-debts, or Talents; whether fifty, or a thouſand; if we aske forgiveneſſe, he tels us, be is ready daily to remit them.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that be our ſinnes never ſo great, ſo great as cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by us, yet he will forgive them, <hi>prop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>We muſt labour how we may ſoundly apply his ſatisfaction to our ſelves; and among other meanes whereby we apply the ſatisfaction of Chriſt to our ſelves, prayer is one: <hi>They ſhall confeſſe their iniquities, then I will remember my covenant, Levit.</hi> 26.40.41. <hi>He ſhall pray unto God, and he will be mercifull unto him, Iob</hi> 33.26. <hi>I confeſſed my ſins unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the wickedneſſe of my ſinne. Propter hoc, ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit omnis ſanctus, Pſal.</hi> 32. <hi>For this cauſe ſhall every one that is holy pray, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>By vertue of this prayer, <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, that the people having com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any ſinne, if they come into the houſe of the Lord, and pray for pardon: <hi>God, who is in Heaven, will heare them,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.47. But this is more plaine in the new Teſtament, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>Did I not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give thee? quia rogaſti me;</hi> and to <hi>Simon Magus: Pray to God, if he will forgive thee the thoughts of thy heart, Acts</hi> 8.22. that is, if we confeſſe, and be ſorry for our ſinnes, and aske pardon, he will forgive us; <hi>How long wilt thou be angry with thy people that prayeth to thee? Pſal.</hi> 66. But we muſt be of the number that is meant by <hi>Nobis,</hi> that is of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, that is, ſuch <hi>as are baptized into Chriſts death, Rom.</hi> 6.

                                 </gap>ghbour,</hi> and the charity that we ought to ſhew towards him, in this fifth Petition: wherein we are to conſider this, that as this law of Prayer, which our Saviour preſcribeth to us, doth eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the law of workes and faith, ſo theſe two <hi>Sicuts</hi> doe comprehend the ſumme of the Law, and the Prophets. The Law ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, Levit.</hi> 19. and the ſame is confirmed by this Petition, wherein we are taught, that if we deſire to have our ſins forgiven of God, we muſt not onely not hate our brother without cauſe, but if he offend, we muſt likewiſe forgive him. Neither doth this Petition concerne our Neighbour and Brethren onely, but our ſelves likewiſe: for hereby we have a pledge of Remiſſion of ſinnes, if we acknowledge, that we have forgiven others: and as the taking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of our ſinnes, is the great fruit and benefit we deſire of God: ſo the ſubordinate meanes that God hath appointed for the end, is the forgiving others that offend us. Now God hath laid upon us this bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed neceſſity of forgiving one another, not onely that he might eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh peace in earth among men; but that by this meanes glory might redound to God on high.</p>
                           <p>In reſpect of our ſelves, this is our eſtate before wee become true Chriſtians: <hi>To be hatefull, and to hate one another, Tit.</hi> 3.3. and that hath a ſorrowfull effect: For <hi>if we bite and devoure one another, we ſhall be conſumed of one another, Gal.</hi> 5.15. To prevent this, Gods will is, that we ſhould not hate, but forgive one another, which unleſſe we doe, we cannot live peaceably; ſo that this Petition hath a reſpect to our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit alſo, as well as our Neighbours, and God himſelfe alſo hath his part in it: for when we have forgiven our brethren, and purged our hearts of all hatred, we are more fit for his ſervice; and contrariwiſe, as without forgiving others we cannot live peaceably one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48000:343"/>ſo neither can we live devoutly towards God: and therefore our Saviour chargeth, <hi>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee, leave there thy gift at the Altar, and goe thy way firſt, and be reconciled, Matth.</hi> 5. and the Apoſtle gives ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe charge, that man and wife ſhould live quietly, <hi>ne interrumpantur preces,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. leſt their prayers be interrupted.</p>
                           <p>Thus it pleaſed the wiſdome of God, in this Petition, to adde this <hi>Sicut,</hi> not for our neighbours ſake onely, nor for our ſelves onely, but alſo in regard of God.</p>
                           <p>The firſt <hi>Sicut,</hi> pertaineth to the imitation of the <hi>Saints</hi> in Heaven, this doth not imply an imitation: For <hi>God</hi> forbid, that God ſhould no otherwiſe forgive us then we forgive our brethren; but it is a meere condition, teaching us, that if we forgive thoſe that are indebted to us, we ſhall obtaine forgiveneſſe of God: for we doe not alwayes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe to Gods commandement, <hi>Forgive one another, as God for Chriſts ſake forgave you, Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>Col.</hi> 3. But by ſaying this Petition wee binde our ſelves to this condition: ſo as we would no otherwayes be forgiven, then as we forgive them.</p>
                           <p>At the firſt we became bound to keepe his Law, which he did deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in ten Commandements, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20. <hi>Deut.</hi> 5. and for not fulfilling of it, we fall into the penalty of <hi>Maledictus, Deut.</hi> 27.</p>
                           <p>Now, becauſe we have not obeyed the Law, we are to undergoe the penalty: and therefore it is ſaid to be <hi>Chirographam contra nos, Col.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>God having the Obligation in his owne hands, might require the forfeiture of us: but it pleaſeth him to enter Bond to us by another Obligation, wherein he binds himſelfe <hi>to forgive our ſinnes</hi> upon this condition, <hi>that we forgive others:</hi> for if we forgive not, then his bond is void, as appeareth by the parable wherein our Saviour ſheweth, that if we will have forgiveneſſe of God, we muſt forgive our brethren, and have compaſſion on our fellow ſervants, as God hath pity on us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>It is Chriſt that freeth us, both from the Obligation of the <hi>ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> and of the <hi>twelve Curſes</hi> and therefore as he that receiveth a benefit doth, as it were, become bound to the thankfull: ſo we enter into a new bond of thankfulneſſe unto God, the condition whereof is, <hi>that we ſhould forgive our brethren, even as wee deſire to be forgiven of God.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>By the words of this Petition, we ſee what our eſtate is, to wit, <hi>qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>bet homo eſt debitor, habens debitorem,</hi> every man is a debtor, having a debtor: for ſo it appeareth by the parable, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. wherein as one was brought that ought a great many Talents to God; ſo he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other that ought an hundred pence; but there is a great difference. The debts that man oweth to God, are great ſinnes; but the debts that man oweth to man, are of ſmall value; we are debtors to God, not onely to keepe the whole Law, but alſo to undergoe the curſe of God, which is due, even <hi>to the leaſt breach of the ſame, Deut.</hi> 27.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we are indebted, not onely for not uſing his Talents to his glory; but for abuſing them in the ſervice of ſinne; even ſo we are debtors one to another, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.14. not onely when we neglect the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48000:344"/>of charity, and juſtice; but, when we of purpoſe doe wrong one to another.</p>
                           <p>Now we can be content that others ſhould forgive us, and therefore if we will have forgiveneſſe of God, for the debts that we owe him, we muſt forgive our brethren, For <hi>what you would that men ſhould doe to you, and in what meaſure, even ſo doe to them, Matth.</hi> 7.</p>
                           <p>Therefore our Saviour in penning this Petition, tels us, that if wee make to our brethren a <hi>releaſe</hi> of our debts, hee will <hi>releaſe</hi> us of his; and this condition is very reaſonable; for <hi>Caine</hi> hath no reaſon to hope for favour of God, though he ſerve him never ſo devoutly one day, when notwithſtanding he hath a purpoſe <hi>to kill his brother the next, Gen.</hi> 4. neither is it reaſonable, that he ſhould ſay to God, <hi>Dimitte mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hi,</hi> that will not ſay to his brother, <hi>Dimitt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </p>
                           <p>The difference betwixt Gods forgiving and ours is, firſt in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that forgive; when we forgive, then one fellow-ſervant forgives another, <hi>as duty binds them, Matth.</hi> 18. But when God forgives us, there <hi>Dominus dimittit ſervum.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Againe, as I have a debtor of my fellow-ſervant, ſo I may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to him, and therefore I ought rather to forgive him: but God cannot be indebted to us, but we are all deepely in his debt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a reaſonable condition that he requires at our hands.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in the things to be remitted, the number of Gods debts are <hi>thouſands,</hi> ours are but <hi>hundreths:</hi> his <hi>Talents,</hi> ours are but <hi>pence, Matth.</hi> 18. The condition therefore is reaſonable on Gods behalfe, if we conſider the excellencie of his perſon, and the vileneſſe of ours: If we regard how greatly we are indebted to God, more then our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren can be to us; <hi>ut pudeat alia lege petere remiſsionem,</hi> that wee may be aſhamed under any other condition to aske forgiveneſſe.</p>
                           <p>Then we may not thinke much, that he requireth this forgiveneſſe at our hands, but magnifie his mercie, that having forfeited our firſt bond, it hath pleaſed him to remit it, and onely to tie us to this: wee are to thanke him that he vouchſafeth, <hi>accipere ſtipulam, pro margaritis,</hi> to accept our ſtubble, for his pearles; for the forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes (which was bought at ſo deere a rate) to accept the forgiveneſſe we ſhew to our brethren.</p>
                           <p>Some would give <hi>thouſands of Rams, and ten thouſand rivers of Oyle</hi> for this great benefit, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6.7. Much more ought wee condeſcend to God, when he offereth us ſo great a benefit, upon ſo eaſie a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and thus we ſee that to be true in ſome part, which ſome of the Heathen have obſerved, <hi>De utilitate capienda etiam ab inimicis:</hi> It is not altogether for our hurt that they wrong and injury us, for unleſſe there were ſome to offend us, we ſhould not have occaſion to exerciſe this part of our mercie, in forgiving: and therefore, where <hi>David</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his enemies to <hi>Bees,</hi> and not to <hi>Waſpes, Pſal.</hi> 118. the reaſon is, for that albeit <hi>Bees</hi> have ſtings; yet they yeeld hony alſo, and ſo no doubt <hi>David</hi> received great comfort inwardly, by meanes of his enemies; though outwardly they perſecuted him, with all the malice they could; for he that can maſter his owne affections ſo farre, as quietly to put up a wrong, offered by an enemy, and to forgive the ſame,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48000:344"/>may be aſſured that his ſinnes are forgiven of God.</p>
                           <p>Wherein we are to conſider the goodneſſe of God, that vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to ſet men in his owne place, and to give men a power to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, even as he himſelfe doth forgive; whereby it commeth to paſſe, that one man is to another even in Gods place, ſo that if wee would know whether God doe remit our ſinnes, or no, we need not to <hi>climb up to Heaven,</hi> to be certified of it, nor <hi>to goe downe into the deepe, for the word is neere, even in our heart, and in our mouth, Rom.</hi> 10.</p>
                           <p>If thy heart tels thee, that thou forgiveſt thy brother, doubt not, but God doth likewiſe forgive thee, and it is his mercie, that he vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafeth to frame his pardons after our pardon, to aſſure us that as wee forgive one another in earth, ſo God forgives us the ſinnes that wee have committed againſt him; and he layeth this neceſſity upon us, not onely to ſhew that he is carefull to have peace among men, but alſo that he would have us to be perfect as himſelfe; for God is ſaid to be <hi>Proclivis ad miſericordiam, tardus ad iram, &amp; vindictam, Prone to mercie, ſlow to wrath and revenge, Pſal.</hi> 145.</p>
                           <p>So Chriſt requiring of us, that we ſhould forgive our brethren that offend us, willeth us to be ſlow to anger, and long ſuffering, as God is, for it is not (as man judgeth) an honourable thing to be revenged. Wicked <hi>Lamech</hi> thought it an honour, to take revenge, <hi>ſeventy times ſeven times, of any that offended him, Gen.</hi> 4.24. but contrariwiſe Chriſt tels Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> that it ſhould be a greater honour for him, to forgive untill <hi>ſeventy times ſeven times, Matth.</hi> 18. Therefore it becomes a Chriſtian, rather to follow Chriſt, then wicked <hi>Lamech:</hi> for as Chriſt ſayes, <hi>It were better to loſe the right eye, and the right hand, then to have the whole body caſt into hell fire, Matth.</hi> 5.29. So it were better for us, to ſuffer wrong for righteouſneſſe, then for worldly honour ſeeke to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive our ſelves of the remiſſion of our ſinnes, which cannot bee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of God, except we be content to put up injuries offered to us.</p>
                           <p>If we will have true honour, let us imitate our heavenly Father, he is ſo farre from taking revenge of them that offend him, that hee lets his <hi>Sunne ſhine upon them, Matth.</hi> 5. So let us account it the greateſt honour for us, to aſpire more and more, to reſemble our Father here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for the nobler ſort of creatures are not deſirous of revenge, but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe that are vileſt and of loweſt power, and of all creatures unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, none ſo angry, as Flies, and Waſpes, and Bees, and of them that have reaſon, Women are more teſty and fretting then Men; and of Men, none more ſubject to anger then ſuch as are ſicke; in their greateſt weakneſſe, then are they moſt angry; which is no ſigne of an honourable quality.</p>
                           <p>Let us therefore count it a ſhame to be like the weakeſt things, in this behalfe, and rather let us imitate the nobler creatures, which are more flow to anger.</p>
                           <p>If we will be honourable, let us learne to get it by the example of ſuch as have true honour, <hi>Ioſeph</hi> in the Court of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> no doubt was an honourable man, and yet hee placed not honour in taking revenge of his brethren, that had rewarded him evill, but in forgiving them, and <hi>doing them good for evill, Gen.</hi> 50.21. <hi>David</hi> was an honourable
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48000:345"/>man, and yet he placed honour in <hi>pardoning Shimei,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. and <hi>to doe good to Mephiboſheth the ſonne of Saul,</hi> that was his deadly enemy: <hi>Solomon</hi> knew, no doubt, what was true honour, and yet he gives us counſell, not to ſeeke honour by revenge: <hi>Say not, I will doe to him, as he hath done to me, Prov.</hi> 24. and the honourable King, that was angry with the unmercifull ſervant, thought it more honour, to draw neare the honour of God, in pardoning, then in revenging, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>The benefit that inſueth upon this condition, is of two ſorts, firſt, <hi>outward,</hi> for by vertue of it, we have a covenant on Gods part; where in he binds himſelfe tous, that he will forgive us, if we forgive our brethren; ſo that we may be bold to challenge him for his promiſe, ſo that we keepe the condition.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>inward,</hi> for when we love the brethren, not in word, and tongue onely, but in deed and truth, that is a meanes for us, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade our hearts before him, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.19. <hi>If we forgive our brethren from our hearts, we may be aſſured that God will forgive us.</hi> So our Saviour affirmeth of the woman, becauſe <hi>ſhe loved much, ſhe had many ſinnes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given her, Luke</hi> 7.27.</p>
                           <p>Some when they came to this Petition, left out this <hi>Sicut,</hi> and ſo paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on to the next Petition: but we muſt uſe this prayer orderly; Chriſt is not mocked, he penned the prayer for us himſelfe, and therefore he can quickly eſpy, if we leave out any of his words, and to teach us, that we ſhould pray in true charity, he hath not onely enjoyned us to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give our brethren, as we would be forgiven; but willeth us before we beginne to pray, to bethinke our ſelves whether we forgive: <hi>Cum ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis ad orandum, Marke</hi> 11. when ye ſtand to pray, forgive: Secondly, as we muſt uſe this <hi>Sicut,</hi> ſo not with our lippes onely, but with our heart, for otſterwife, we doe <hi>imprecari nobis,</hi> we pray for vengeance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our ſelves, and Chriſt may ſay to us, <hi>Ex ore tuo te judicabo ſerve nequam, Luke</hi> 19. We cannot curſe our ſelves more bitterly, then if we ſay to God, forgive us, as we forgive our debters, unleſſe wee d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>e indeed forgive them.</p>
                           <p>As we runne in debt with God daily, and ſo need daily forgiveneſſe, the ſame meaſure of charity we are to ſhew to others that offend us: by forgiving them their treſpaſſes.</p>
                           <p>We muſt not thinke it enough to forgive them, till <hi>ſeven times,</hi> but <hi>untill ſeventy times ſeven times,</hi> and as we would not have a counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit forgiveneſſe of God, ſo we muſt be carefull to forgive our brethren from our heart, otherwiſe he will call backe his word and promiſe made to us touching the remiſsion of our ſinnes, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.35.</p>
                           <p>Whereas ſome count it a ſufficient forgiveneſſe to forgive onely, though they doe not forget, they muſt know that it is onely, <hi>Semiple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na remiſsio,</hi> a forgiveneſſe by halfes: for we deſire God by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, that he will not onely <hi>forgive, but forget our ſinnes; and remember not our old ſinnes, Pſal.</hi> 79.8. Therefore wee muſt performe the ſame meaſure of charity in this behalfe to our brethren: and whereas the <hi>meſſenger of Satan doth ſo buffet us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and our owne corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſo prevailes with us, that we cannot utterly forget an injury, yet ſo long as we ſhew not a revenge in deed, nor in word, nor in looke, but
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48000:345"/>ſtrive to maſter our corrupt affection, we ſhall be accounted accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that we have, and not according to that we have not, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> S. 12.</p>
                           <p>As for that which ſome object, that ſo the <hi>law of juſtice is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne by this kinde of mercie, Rom.</hi> 3.31. It is not ſo, for <hi>mercie triumpheth over juſtice, Iam.</hi> 2.</p>
                           <p>Now, as prayer is a meanes to apply Chriſts benefits and mercie to our ſoules, as Chriſt ſheweth, <hi>I forgave thee, becauſe thou prayedſt me, Matth.</hi> 18. So that is not enough unleſſe we uſe charity and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; to <hi>dimitte tu,</hi> we muſt adde, <hi>nos dimittimus,</hi> the want whereof cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the King <hi>to deale ſo ſeverely with the unmercifull ſervant, Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>Now, mercie which is the ſecond meanes of application, ſlands in giving, and forgiving, <hi>Quicquid praeſtatur indigenti Eleemoſynae est.</hi> Therefore becauſe theſe have need of forgiveneſſe which offend, wee ſhould doe a worke of mercie in forgiving them when they doe us wrong, and both thoſe kinde of almes and mercie are alike accepted of God, and therefore in the Law he ordained as well <hi>peace-offerings,</hi> as <hi>meat-offerings.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That mercie is a meanes to us to apply this benefit unto our ſelves, which Chriſt offereth, appeareth by theſe places, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.6. <hi>with mercie and faithfulneſſe ſinnes are forgiven, Iſa.</hi> 58.7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.27. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11. <hi>Date Eleemoſynam, &amp; omnia ſunt munda.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This is that which maketh both prayer and faſting acceptable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and without which all prayer is rejected as <hi>hypocriticall, Mat.</hi> 6.16. Thus muſt we have oyle from him, and the veſſell to receive it in us, <hi>dimitte &amp; dimittitis,</hi> that is both prayer and mercie.</p>
                           <p>As we pray to God for pardon of our ſinnes, ſo we muſt forgive others, now Chriſt maketh choyce of that kind of mercie, which ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth in forgiving, becauſe it is common to poore and rich, for all can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give, but the poore may forgive as well as the rich, and therefore it is the duty of us all to forgive one another, if we will be forgiven of God.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, he maketh choyce of this mercie, as the greateſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellenteſt, for nature will move us to give him that is in need, and wee cannot in ſuch caſe hide our ſelves from our owne fleſh: But when we doe not onely forgive him that hath done us wrong, but alſo offer kindneſſe to him that did provoke us to anger, that is a ſupernaturall worke.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, it is the fitteſt mercie, for we deſire to bee remitted, and therefore the fitteſt meanes to obtaine remiſsion is, that mercy which ſtandeth in remiſsion, and forgiving of others.</p>
                           <p>The mercy that we ſhew in this behalfe, is <hi>active mercie;</hi> that which God promiſeth us, if we forgive our brethren, is a <hi>paſsive mercie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Of the <hi>active mercie,</hi> our Saviour ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed are the mercifull, for they ſhall obtaine mercie, Matth.</hi> 5. But contrariwiſe, <hi>here ſhall be judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mercileſſe to him that ſheweth no mercie, Iames</hi> 2.13. Wherefore wee muſt ſo deale with thoſe which offend us, that wee may ſay to God: <hi>Ecce miſericordiam activam, praeſta mihi paſsivam:</hi> Behold my
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48000:346"/>
                              <hi>active mercie,</hi> performe to me thy <hi>paſſive mercie.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And to ſhew you the neceſsity of this duty on our parts, Chriſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving penned this Petition upon this condition, is not contented there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, but having ended the prayer, he returnes to the ſame matter, and ſheweth why we ſhould forgive our debters: <hi>For if yee</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will forgive you yours, but if you will not, neither will God forgive you,</hi> and hereof he hath given an example in the parable of the King, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. who to ſhew to us, what we are to looke for at Gods hands, is ſaid to have beene loving and mercifull, at the firſt, to him that was indebted ſo farre unto him: But when the ſame party having the debt which hee ought, pardoned, would notwithſtanding have preſent payment of his fellow-ſervant; then the Kings affection was turned, and he became ſevere and rough, and committed him, till he had paid all that was due.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His is the Petition that concernes ſin to come: for <hi>Remiſsion,</hi> which was the thing we prayed for laſt, is referred to <hi>ſinnes paſt, Rom.</hi> 3.25. and wee are no leſſe to deſire of <hi>God,</hi> that he will give us abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to reſiſt ſinne to come; then to be gracious to us in pardoning our ſinnes already committed: thus much we are given to underſtand, by this, that this Petition is chained to the former, with the copulative, <hi>And,</hi> as if that were not perfected, without this, no more in deed is it, for as God lets goe his hold, ſo muſt we let goe ours; and if wee will have God to remit our former ſinnes; we muſt beware, that we doe not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinne againſt his Majeſty afreſh; but that we ſtrive againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to come: For as the Pſalmiſt ſpeakes: <hi>If I incline to wickednes in my heart, the Lord will not heare me, Pſal.</hi> 66.16. If I purpoſe ſtill to continue in ſinne, I ſhall in vaine pray, <hi>Forgive me my ſinnes.</hi> But contrariwayes, he that doth not onely confeſſe, but alſo forſake his ſinnes, <hi>he ſhall have mercie, Prov.</hi> 28.13.</p>
                           <p>If <hi>accounting it ſufficient, that we have ſpent the time of our life paſt in ſinne, we ſhall reſolve henceforth to live, ſo much time as remaineth for us in the fleſh, after the will of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3. Then may wee aſſure our ſelves, that God will be mercifull unto us; and will remember our ſinnes and iniquities no more. And that which we are to performe in this behalfe, is, the ſecond part of <hi>Remiſsion,</hi> which is oppoſed, both to retention and intention: that is, as we would have God not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our ſinnes, but freely to pardon them, ſo our care muſt be, that ſinne be more remiſſe in us: for whereas in the laſt Petition wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered a <hi>Double debt,</hi> one of <hi>Duty,</hi> another of <hi>Forfeiture,</hi> our deſire was, not to have both forgiven, but we deſired to be forgiven, <hi>quia non pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitimus; non ne praeſtemus:</hi> becauſe we performe it not; not that wee might not at all performe it.</p>
                           <p>Howſoever our prayer to God is, that he would not lay upon us the penalty, which we have runne into, by not keeping his Law, yet we are ſtill bound to doe our duty.</p>
                           <pb n="110" facs="tcp:48000:347"/>
                           <p>Now, whereas the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Hic eſt omnis fructus, ut auſeratur peccatum, Iſay</hi> 27. We may not thinke, that ſinne is taken away, when God, for his part, doth remit the guilt of our ſinnes paſt, for ſin conſiſts not onely of an offence, or guilt, but of an iſſue, or inclination to ſinne: ſo that our care muſt be, as well that wee pray, that this running iſſue may be ſtopped, as that puniſhment due to us for ſinnes paſt be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and to this end, both parts of repentance are required of us: that is, <hi>Sorrow for ſinnes paſt, and a provident care to avoid ſinne to come:</hi> we muſt by prayer ſeeke for grace of God, <hi>non modo qua deleatur debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, ſed ne contrahatur debitum:</hi> not onely, that our debts may be done away, but that it may not be contracted; as the widow, by the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God, had ſufficient oyle, not onely to pay her Creditors with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, but alſo to live upon afterward, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4. So we muſt ſeeke of Chriſt, the oyle of his grace, both for the diſcharging of our ſinnes, and for an holy life.</p>
                           <p>As we would be glad to heare this voyce from Chriſt, <hi>Remiſſa ſunt tibi peccata, Luke</hi> 7. So we muſt be content with this: <hi>Vade, &amp; noli amplius peccare: Goe thy way, and ſinne no more, Iohn</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>As God on his part doth covenant with us, <hi>that he will remember our ſinnes and iniquities no more, Ier.</hi> 31. So, that which he requireth of us, <hi>Haec eſt via, ambulate inea, Iſa.</hi> 30.21. For it is not enough for us to <hi>confeſſe our ſinnes and be ſorry, Pſal.</hi> 38. nor yet to performe our active mercy by giving and forgiving, except we have a reſolute purpoſe to forſake the ſinnes we have heretofore committed: for if being waſhed from our old ſinnes, we ſhall wallow in the mire like ſwine, and return to our vomit, then <hi>ſhall our latter end be worſe then our beginning,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. This is one reaſon, why this copulative conjunction is ſet before this Petition.</p>
                           <p>Another is, in regard of the fickleneſſe of our eſtate: wee may not thinke our ſelves ſecure when we have forgiveneſſe of our ſinnes. The Apoſtles of our Saviour Chriſt having received the Sacrament, which as Chriſt told them, was a ſeale of the remiſsion of ſinnes, purchaſed by the ſhedding of his bloud, fell into a ſleepineſſe, ſo as they were not able in time of greateſt perill, to watch with their Maſter one houre: therefore he was faine to warne them: <hi>Pray, that yee enter not into ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, Matth.</hi> 26. the reaſon is, becauſe the Devill is moſt malicious againſt them that are recovered out of his thraldome: <hi>For when the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit is gone out of a man, he is never quiet, till he returne againe,</hi> and that he may, he will uſe all the meanes he can, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. So that they (of all others) are in moſt danger, and moſt ſubject to the malice and rage of the Devill, that are reſtored out of the ſtate of ſinne, into the ſtate of grace: and therefore we pray, that as God in his mercy doth vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to pardon our ſinnes paſt; ſo it will pleaſe him to ſtrengthen us with his grace, that we may withſtand the temptations of Satan.</p>
                           <p>The Petition hath two things to be conſidered, the <hi>Temptation,</hi> and the <hi>Leading. Temptation</hi> (that we may know what we aske, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.) is a <hi>Triall</hi> or <hi>Proofe,</hi> and is of two ſorts: <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, <hi>and</hi> 
                              <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, the one good, the other evill, the one is made by God, the other by Satan.</p>
                           <p>God is ſaid to <hi>tempt</hi> us, when he maketh triall of our faith, which
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:48000:347"/>triall is <hi>more precious then gold,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. as in <hi>Abraham,</hi> or when hee <hi>trieth our patience, Iames</hi> 1. as in <hi>Iob:</hi> for while wee live in this world we are <hi>ſpectaculum Angelis, &amp; hominibus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>God therefore in his wiſedome thinkes it good to trie our faith, and patience, by laying affliction upon us, that albeit hee know us ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, yet that both Men and Angels may have a proofe of our faith, he trieth us: for as the droſſe is conſumed with fire, and the pure gold remaineth behinde: ſo the pureneſſe of our faith is tried with the fire of affliction: this is that Fan which Chriſt is ſaid to have in his hand, whereby he <hi>purgeth his floure, and ſeparateth the good Corne from the Chaffe, Matth.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>The other <hi>proofe</hi> or tryall is, that which Satan makes: for as God <hi>tempteth Abraham, Gen.</hi> 22. <hi>for his good:</hi> ſo Satan <hi>tempted Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. but not for his good, but onely to draw him away from his <hi>God:</hi> as Chriſt hath his Fan, ſo Satan hath his, <hi>Luke</hi> 22. <hi>Satan hath deſired to ſift and winnow you.</hi> The difference is, that whereas God by affliction thinketh good to prove how ſtedfaſtly we beleeve in him, and how willingly we will undergoe the croſſe for his ſake: The Devils pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is, that by all meanes he may quench our faith, and daſh our patience.</p>
                           <p>The Devils triall therefore is, <hi>tentatio ad detrimentum, non ad expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentum.</hi> Gods <hi>tentation</hi> maketh us happy: <hi>Bleſſed is he that endureth temptation, Iames</hi> 1. but the Devils temptation brings us to miſery, and this latter is that againſt which we pray, and it is of two ſorts: firſt, that which the Apoſtle cals, <hi>tentatio humana,</hi> ſuch as is incident to the nature of man: ſecondly, <hi>tentatio Satanica.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Humane temptations</hi> are ſuch as are heceſſary, and cannot be avoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, by reaſon of the corruption of nature; of which the Prophet ſpeaketh, when he prayeth, <hi>Libera me de neceſſitatibus meis, Pſal.</hi> 25.16: The Apoſtle doth more plainely expreſſe it, when he cals it <hi>the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the fleſh, Rom.</hi> 6. and the <hi>ſinne that dwels in us, Rom.</hi> 7. which cauſeth this neceſſity, that while we remaine in the body, the <hi>fleſh will ever luſt against the ſpirit, Gal.</hi> 5. But there is another kinde of <hi>tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which is <hi>Devilliſh;</hi> when we doe not ſinne of infirmity, or through the neceſſary weakeneſſe of the fleſh: but of malitious purpoſe, that whereof the Prophet ſpeaketh, <hi>Be not mercifull to them that treſpaſſe of malitious wickedneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 59. and, <hi>Keepe thy ſervant from preſumptuous ſinnes, Pſal.</hi> 19. Theſe ſinnes proceed not from that neceſſity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which doth accompany our nature: but from that corruption of nature, which the Apoſtle doth call the <hi>ſuperfluity of wickedneſſe, Iames</hi> 1.2. Theſe proceed not from ſinne that dwels in us, but from that ſin, <hi>which reigneth in us, Rom.</hi> 6.

                           <p>For the better underſtanding of this point, we are to conſider what are the <hi>tentations,</hi> and <hi>tentamenta:</hi> that is, the things whereby wee are tempted.</p>

                              </list> The <hi>Tempter</hi> within us is, <hi>our owne concupiſcence, Iames</hi> 1.14. without which the outward <hi>Tempters</hi> ſhould not onely not hurt us, but alſo greatly profit us: for the Devill ſhall in vaine tempt us, and the evill examples of the world ſhall not allure us, unleſſe we, in the luſts of our hearts, doe ſuffer our ſelves to be overcome: and therefore one ſaith well: <hi>Teipſum vince, &amp; victus eſt mundus &amp; Satanas.</hi> If there be neither covetouſneſſe in us, nor the luſt of the fleſh, the Devill ſhall not be able to prevaile againſt us, but we ſhall ſtand unconquered, both of worldly luſts and of the luſts of the fleſh.</p>
                           <p>The things whereby the Devill tempteth us, are <hi>Maſſah,</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribah, Pſal.</hi> 95.8. whereby is underſtood, <hi>Proſperity</hi> and <hi>Adverſity.</hi> One while, as a Serpent, he allureth us by pleaſures, and if he prevaile not that way, then, like a roaring Lion, he terrifieth with violent danger: and that he may have his will of us, by one of theſe meanes, <hi>hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witcheth our underſtanding, Gal.</hi> 3. ſo that we either make great account of thoſe things, which indeed are of leaſt value, or elſe judge the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger which he threatneth, to be more terrible then it is.</p>
                           <p>From this Petition, we are to acknowledge, that where we pray, that God will deliver us from <hi>tentation:</hi> firſt, in regard of our ſelves, we are unable to encounter with theſe <hi>temptations,</hi> and to withſtand the leaſt <hi>temptation,</hi> and yet the <hi>grace of God is ſufficient for us:</hi> ſo that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit, in the light of our owne underſtanding, we cannot diſcerne what is true pleaſure, or what is in deed to be feared; yet as the Prophet ſpeakes, <hi>In lumine tuo videbimus lumen; In thy light we ſhall ſee light, Pſal.</hi> 36. and though the meſſenger of Satan buffet us never ſo much, yet Gods grace ſhall make us to have the victory, without which we are not able to reſiſt the firſt temptations.</p>
                           <p>Which conſiderations ſerve to keepe us from pride, and <hi>to worke in us humility,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in regard of our <hi>tempters,</hi> we are to acknowledge, that the Devill, much leſſe any thing elſe, cannot be able to tempt us, without Gods permiſſion: ſo he was not able to touch <hi>Iob,</hi> untill hee had leave of God, nor the heard of ſwine, till Chriſt had permitted him to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.</p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee that Satan is chained by God, ſo that he cannot goe further then God will give him leave, which maketh for our comfort.</p>
                           <p>Temptation is neceſſary, and therefore we pray not, <hi>ne tentet nos Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanas,</hi> but <hi>ne Deus nos inducat:</hi> For it is Gods will to uſe Satans ſervice in this worke, and that if we feele that our corruption doth yeeld to ſinne, we are to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>Let God ariſe, Pſal.</hi> 68. and, <hi>Save me O God, Pſal.</hi> 69. Alſo with <hi>Ezechiah, Domine vim patior, reſponde pro me, Iſa.</hi> 36. <hi>O Lord I ſuffer oppreſsion, comfort thou me.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Touching the <hi>leading into tentation,</hi> we deſire <hi>not to be led,</hi> which hath two expoſitions: firſt, that God, who knowes our weakneſſe, will not give leave to the Devill to <hi>tempt</hi> us at all, by any of thoſe meanes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the iſſue of <hi>tentation</hi> is doubtfull, for many excellent men, even
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48000:348"/>the Saints of God have beene overcome thereby.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, at the leaſt <hi>ne inducat, that he leade us not into them,</hi> which have three differences: firſt, in reſpect of <hi>God,</hi> that albeit the Devils deſire be <hi>to ſift us, Luke</hi> 22. yet, <hi>ne inducas tu,</hi> though the lying ſpirit be ready to intice us, that we might fall, yet, that God would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to goe forth, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. yet that he would not deliver us over in Satans hands, and leave us to our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in regard <hi>of us,</hi> that we commit not ſinne that leads there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, for <hi>qui ducitur volens ducitur:</hi> but that if we needs muſt yeeld to temptations, it may rather lay hold on us by violence againſt our wils, then leade us: ſo the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Tentatio vos non appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hendit, Tentation hath not taken hold of you:</hi> and when our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Orate ne intretis intentationem, pray that ye enter not into tentation:</hi> his meaning is, that willingly and wittingly, and of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of your ſelves, otherwayes then as the infirmity of your fleſh doth compell you: for if any willingly enter into tentation, theſe God ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to be led into it, ſo as they cannot get out any more; that is, the Gentiles till they be effectually called, are ſaid to <hi>commit all uncleanneſſe with greedineſſe, Eph.</hi> 4.19. So we doe not devoure the temptations that are incident to our nature, and that as the <hi>Syriake</hi> word, uſed by our Saviour, is, we take not paine to ſatisfie the tentations of Satan, as it were to climbe up into an high tree.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, in reſpect <hi>of the nature of the Greeke word,</hi> which is rather <hi>ne inferas,</hi> the <hi>ne inducas.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Of Chriſts leading into tentation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. it is ſaid, <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, that is, ſo led, as that he was brought backe againe, but our leading by the Devill, is, ſo to be carried into temptations, as that withall we are left there to our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>Chriſts tentation had an iſſue, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>noſtra non habet exitum,</hi> ours hath no iſſue: but our prayer is not onely, that it be againſt our will, if at any time we be tempted, but that in the tentation he would ſo hold us by the hand that we may get out of it, that albeit we be led into it, that we may be brought backe againe.</p>
                           <p>From whence this queſtion ariſeth, <hi>Whether God lead any into tentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo as they never get out of it againe:</hi> The anſwer is, that there are ſome ſuch, but they are thoſe that firſt ſuffer themſelves to be led, even as he hardeneth no mans heart, but his that firſt hardeneth his own heart.</p>
                           <p>Of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> it is ſaid, that albeit <hi>Aarons rod eate up the inchanters rods,</hi> that yet <hi>he hardened his heart, Exod.</hi> 7.13. After <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. when the Sorcerers told him, <hi>Digitus Dei hic eſt, this is the ſinger of God:</hi> yet he hardened his owne heart; and then God ſeeing his obſtinacie, <hi>Indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit corejus, hardened his heart, Exod.</hi> 12.</p>
                           <p>So when <hi>Ahab</hi> had firſt <hi>ſold himſelfe to worke wickedneſſe,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.20. then it pleaſed God to deliver <hi>him to the lying ſpirit, to deceive him, that he might fall,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 22. <hi>Becauſe Ephraim would have many Altars to ſerve, God gave them many Altars, Hoſ.</hi> 8.11.</p>
                           <p>That we be not led into tentation, the meanes that we are to uſe is, that we put from before our face the <hi>ſtumbling blocks of iniquity, Ezek.</hi> 14. that we reſtraine our eyes and mouthes from beholding, or ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48000:349"/>that which is evill, that we reſtraine our feete, as the Wiſeman ſaith: <hi>Keepe thy way farre from her, and come not into the doore of her houſe, Prov.</hi> 5.8. <hi>For can a man take fire in his boſome, and his clothes not be burnt? Prov.</hi> 6.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if we will not be led into tentation, we muſt not lead our ſelves, nor tempt our ſelves, nor grope for ſinne, for the Devils tenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot hurt us: it ſhall be a meanes to grace us, if we withſtand it: but if we will be drawne away of our owne luſts, then wee cannot but be led.</p>
                           <p>As we muſt forbeare the occaſion of ſinne, ſo muſt wee uſe the meanes that may keepe us from it, that is prayer.</p>
                           <p>We muſt make <hi>a covenant with our eyes, Iob</hi> 31. ſo we ſhall not bee tempted.</p>
                           <p>As we prayed, that Gods will, touching <hi>ſanctification,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. and <hi>ſuffering,</hi> may be done of us, ſo we are to pray, not generally to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the temptations of ſinne; but particularly, from the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of any ſeverall ſin, whereunto we are inclined: if to <hi>worldly luſts, Tit.</hi> 2.12. that he would keepe us from them; If <hi>to the luſts of the fleſh,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. that he will not ſuffer us to be tempted of them neither, that as our tentation increaſeth, ſo his ſtrength may increaſe, and if not increaſe, then that he will cauſe his tentation to decreaſe.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>His laſt Petition concerneth the laſt of thoſe three evills, which we deſire to have removed from us; under which we comprehend all miſeries and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of this life, for that is it which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our underſtandeth by the evill of the day, in the laſt verſe of this Chapter.</p>
                           <p>So there is a plaine oppoſition betwixt this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition and the fourth.</p>
                           <p>As there by <hi>daily bread,</hi> wee underſtood all things neceſſary for this preſent life: ſo when we ſay, <hi>Deliver us from evill,</hi> we ſeeke to be delivered from all ſuch things as are laborious and troubleſome to us in the ſame.</p>
                           <p>There are that make but ſixe Petitions of this Prayer, ſaying, that the two laſt are but one, but they have no warrant for it.</p>
                           <p>The ancient Church hath alwaies divided it into ſeven, and this diviſion they grounded upon the motive, which cauſed our Saviour Chriſt to pen this prayer, which was the avoyding of that <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, uſed by the Heathen, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 7. into which they cannot chuſe but fall, which affirme, that theſe two laſt Petitions containe but one thing, wherein they are deceived; for <hi>temptation,</hi> and <hi>evill</hi> are not of one ſcantling.</p>
                           <p>Every evill is not <hi>tentation,</hi> neither is every <hi>temptation evill.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Some things are evill in their owne kind, as wolves, and Kites: other things are not onely evill in themſelves, but bring forth evill effects, for our ſinnes are not onely <hi>evill,</hi> but the calamities and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries which our ſinnes bring upon us, are alſo evill: and therefore we are to pray no leſſe againſt the one, then againſt the other.</p>
                           <p>Touching the miſery of this life, we are to pray as the Prophet wils us, for the deliverance from them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. <hi>Call upon mee in the day of thy trouble.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That this and the former cannot be one Petition, appeareth, for
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48000:350"/>where we pray that we be not led into temptation, we deſire that we may do no evill, when we pray that we may be delivered from evill, our deſire is that we may ſuffer no evill.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt we pray againſt <hi>malum culpae,</hi> in the ſecond againſt <hi>malum poenae.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The firſt is an evill of our owne doing, the other of Gods doing, as the Prophet ſpeakes <hi>Amos</hi> 3. <hi>Non eſt malum in Civitate, quod non facit Dominus.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As before ſinne committed, wee deſired <hi>non induci:</hi> ſo here, when we have committed ſinne, our deſire is, that God would not deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us to our Ghoſtly enemy, that he may afflict us in this life with temporall plagues, nor in the life to come keepe us in eternall torments.</p>
                           <p>When we deſire that God will deliver us from the miſeries of this life, and of the life to come, we have theſe things to conſider: firſt, that the caſe of Chriſtian men is not like the ſtate of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, for they had <hi>Joves white gods,</hi> from whom they received good things, and <hi>blacke gods,</hi> whom they called <hi>depulſores malorum:</hi> but Chriſtians have but one God to flie to, whom they acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be both <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, and <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, a God that doth not onely give us good things, but takes from us thoſe that are evill: ſo God teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth of himſelfe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that he <hi>is not onely his exceeding great reward, but alſo his ſhield, Gen.</hi> 15. both which we are to conſider in this, that in Scripture he is compared to a rocke.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, that the devill hath a deſire to carry us away into ſinne and tranſgreſſion, to the end he may endanger our ſoules, and if he cannot hurt us that way; then he will labour to do us ſome outward miſchiefe: if he cannot prevaile as a <hi>tempter,</hi> yet that he may hurt us as a <hi>tormenter.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>So he dealt with <hi>Job,</hi> who for that he was a juſt and perfect man, ſo as Satan could not tempt him to ſinne againſt God, therefore his deſire was, that he might touch his body, and torment him with outward loſſes, for his delight is evermore in doing of miſchiefe; if he can no longer vexe the ſoule of man, yet he will crave this leave, that he may torment the poore hogges, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.32.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that we have two kind of helpes againſt this evill: firſt, that precaution which our Saviour tells us of in the former Petition, that before we commit ſin, we pray, <hi>non induci;</hi> that neither tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion come at us, nor we at it. Secondly, that albeit wee by ſin are fallen into evill, yet there is a <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, or ſalving to be looked for of God, who will deliver us after that we are delivered into the hands of our adverſarie, as in the firſt Petition, we pray that we may not fall into evill by yeelding to temptation: ſo here, if wee be fallen, yet God would deliver us out of it. Both theſe helpes are aſcribed to God.</p>
                           <p>Of the firſt it is ſaid to him, he that maketh his prayer for his help, <hi>the enemy ſhall not be able to do him hurt, and the ſonne of wickedneſſe ſhall not come nigh him, Pſal.</hi> 89. Of the other, <hi>Let not the waterflood drowne mee, nor the deepe ſwallow mee up, and let not the pit ſhut her mouth upon mee, Pſ.</hi> 69.16.</p>

                           <p>Touching the evill from which we deſire to be delivered, <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome,</hi> and the reſt of the Greek Church, expound it of the devill, who is <hi>Lerna malorum,</hi> or the greateſt evill that can befall us, which expoſition is grounded upon the Article, <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap> but this expoſition is too narrow: and for the holy word is beſt expounded, when it is moſt enlarged: ſo that wee ſhall have a full underſtanding of this matter, if under the word <hi>Evill,</hi> we include whatſoever is evill, and ſo deſire generally to be delivered from it: but if we deſire to be delivered from whatſoever is evill, then from our ſelves, (ſaith <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine:</hi>) for we are evill, and ſo wee have need to pray: for as, when we aske forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, it is from thoſe ſinnes, unto which our luſt hath already drawne us away into ſinne: ſo when we ſay, <hi>Libera nos à malo,</hi> that is, <hi>ab abſtrahente,</hi> from that infirmity of the fleſh, and neceſſity of ſinning, which doth accompany our nature, in regard whereof the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Quis me liberabit de hoc corpore mortis?

                           <p>If we underſtand by evill, <hi>Satan,</hi> then we pray to be delivered from him, not onely when he playeth the ſubtill ſerpent, and <hi>chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth himſelfe into an Angell of light,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. but <hi>when hee playeth the Lyon,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.

                           <p>Secondly, from his clawes, under which are comprehended all temporall calamities: firſt, the <hi>loſſe of life,</hi> againſt which the Apoſtles, being in a great tempeſt, pray unto Chriſt, that he would ſave them: <hi>Maſter, careſt thou not that we periſh? Mark.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>of good name,</hi> whereof the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Libera me à contrariis hominibus, Pſal.</hi> 114.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, the <hi>loſſe of goods,</hi> concerning which, when the Lord had formed Graſſe-hoppers to deſtroy their fruit, the Prophet prayed, <hi>O Lord God, ſpare I beſeech thee, Amos</hi> 7.2. And this is the remedy in all outward afflictions, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith: <hi>If there be dearth in the land, through blaſting, caterpillar, or graſſe-hopper: then if the people come into the Temple, and ſay, Libera nos à malo,</hi> God will heare their prayers and deliver them, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 8.37. Therefore in that dearth which is ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6. where <hi>corne was given by meaſure, and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:48000:351"/>weight,</hi> the remedy they had, was prayer: <hi>How long Lord doſt thou deferre to avenge our bloods?</hi> The reaſon why we pray to be delivered from theſe miſeries, is, that we may the better intend Gods ſervice; ſo ſaid <hi>David: Deliver mee from the ſlanders of men, that I may keepe thy commandements, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt doth not expreſſely name tribulation, affliction and cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, though they be comprehended under the word <hi>Evill.</hi> wherein we are to obſerve, that in this Petition, as in the reſt, he tempers his ſtile with great wiſedome. Therefore outward trouble may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate to our good, and therefore he teacheth us not to pray, that God will deliver us from them abſolutely, but from that evill which is in them; and in this ſenſe we may pray to be delivered, <hi>à malo panis,</hi> as well as <hi>à malo famis:</hi> for bread, which of it ſelfe is good, may turne to our hurt: and therefore <hi>Solomon</hi> prayeth, <hi>Give mee not riches, leſt I be full, and ſay, Who is the Lord? neither give mee pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſt through want I be driven to ſteale, and take the name of my God in vaine, Prov.</hi> 30.</p>
                           <p>There is both evill and good in both, and therefore we pray to be delivered from the evill: for if God ſee that it is good for us to be humbled with want, then we are not to pray againſt it.</p>
                           <p>Where we deſire <hi>to be delivered,</hi> firſt, we acknowledge how little we are able our ſelves; an haire, or a crumme of bread oftentimes is enough to caſt away a man: for the meaneſt creatures are able to hurt us, except God deliver us: and as we cannot help our ſelves, ſo if we looke about us, there is none to ſuccour us. So will the King himſelfe tell us, who of all others ſeemeth moſt able to help: <hi>If the Lord do not ſuccour thee, wherewith can I help thee?</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.27.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore we may not truſt to our ſelves, nor to any other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine help, or power, but to <hi>God</hi> the great deliverer, to whom Chriſt hath taught us to pray: <hi>Libera nos à malo.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, herein wee acknowledge our deſire, which is <hi>to be delivered:</hi> the word is <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, which implyeth ſuch a deliverance which doth rid us from bondage, or captivity: wherefore wee uſe this word as a motive, that God will the rather deliver us; becauſe, if the evill, which lyeth upon us, continue long, it will make us the devils bond-men, and we are his ſervants, and deſire that he may not take us captives at his will, <hi>but that wee may come out of his ſnare,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. to do God ſervice, and not onely ſo, but that our ſervice may be done freely, and with cheerfulneſſe, for that wee are his children, and he our Father: that is, as the Prophet ſpeakes: <hi>When God hath ſet our hearts at liberty, we may runne the way of his Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Pſal.</hi> 119.</p>
                           <p>But if we will be delivered from the devill indeed, we muſt have this freedome of Chriſt the Son of God, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Si filius vos liberaverit, verè liberi eritis, Joh.</hi> 8. for he onely is able perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſave us out of the thraldome of Satan.</p>
                           <p>The devill indeed is ſubtile, and playeth the ſerpent, but Chriſt is the wiſedome of God, and knoweth well enough to keepe us from temptation.</p>
                           <pb n="119" facs="tcp:48000:351"/>
                           <p>The Devill is cruell, and roareth like a Lyon, but Chriſt, who is the power of God, is able to free us from evils, to ſave us from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9.</p>
                           <p>The meanes and wayes whereby the Sonne of God, who is his wiſedome and power, doth free us from evill, is firſt, <hi>non inducendo,</hi> that is, not to ſuffer us to be tempted at all, for ſo we ſhould be freed both from the evill of ſinne, and from the evill of puniſhment, which is the effect of ſinne, but for as much as there is none upon whom the devill hath not at leaſt laid his nailes, and as it were ſcratched with his clawes by outward afflictions, we are not to looke for that meanes of deliverance: the Apoſtles themſelves had not this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: for Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> that was a choſen veſſell, had the <hi>meſſenger of Sathan to buffet him:</hi> even the corruption of his fleſh, which did ſtill tempt him to ſinne, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. And for outward affliction, it is the caſe of all Chriſtians generally, <hi>All that will live godly in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>So that the godly may not looke for their paradiſe on earth, Chriſt hath fore-told, <hi>In the world you ſhall have trouble, Joh.</hi> 16. as for their joyes and comfort, it is elſewhere to be had: <hi>Merces veſtra magna eſt in coelis, Mat.</hi> 5. But if they be without tribulation in this life, if they be in the ſtate of thoſe that come <hi>into no misfortune like others, Pſ.</hi> 73. it is an evill ſigne, and they little differ from the world, <hi>which have their portion in this life;</hi> whereas the troubles and miſeries of this world, are to the godly, a pledge of the joyes that are to come: and yet ſometimes he giveth them a taſte of his future mercie, by bleſſing them on earth: <hi>I have ſet before thee an open doore, becauſe thou haſt a little ſtrength, Rev.</hi> 3.8.</p>
                           <p>But we pray here for a deliverance after wee are fallen into evill, and this deliverance is performed foure waies: Firſt, when God doth quickly take the evill from us, and not ſuffer it to continue to our ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter over-throw. Such a deliverance is that when hee ſuffereth his wrath to indure but a little ſeaſon, when, <hi>though he ſend heavineſſe over night, yet he cauſeth joy to come in the morning, Pſal.</hi> 30.</p>
                           <p>It was a great cauſe of griefe to the Apoſtles, that Chriſt ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his departure from them, ſaid, <hi>A little while, and yee ſhall not ſee mee;</hi> but he delivered them out of this griefe, by comforting them with the hope of his ſpeedy returne, when he ſaid, <hi>And yet a while and yee ſhall ſee mee againe, Joh.</hi> 16. and as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith: This is a great means to deliver us out of our afflictions when we know, that it is but <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, a tribulation, that as it is but light in it ſelfe, ſo it is but momentany, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, God doth deliver us from evill, when he doth mixe ſome co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>fort with our affliction, that may make us to beare it the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Such comfort it pleaſed God to mixe with <hi>Joſephs</hi> trouble, who was firſt ſold to be a ſlave by his owne brethren, after caſt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by means of his wicked Miſtreſſe; but in the midſt of his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, God did not only bring him out of priſon, but brought him into favour with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which made him forget all his labour &amp; travell. Wherefore he called his firſt ſon <hi>Manaſſeh, of forgetting, Gen.</hi> 41.51.</p>
                           <pb n="120" facs="tcp:48000:352"/>
                           <p>Thus God tempered the afflictions of <hi>David,</hi> as himſelfe confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth: <hi>In the multitude of the ſorrowes of my heart, thy comforts have refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed my ſoule, Pſalm.</hi> 94. And the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>Bleſſed be God, for hee giveth us comfort in all our tribulation: ſo as we are able to comfort others with the ſame comfort that he miniſtred to us,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, when he gives us patience to endure our affliction, which is a greater benefit then the former: for if we ſuffer wrong, and take it patiently, then there is thankes with God, and we follow the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, who ſuffered for us, <hi>though he had done no ſinne,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. and as it is a thing thank-worthy with God, ſo the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chaſtiſeſt, O Lord, that thou mayeſt give him patience in the time of adverſitie, Pſal</hi> 94.13.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore the Apoſtle exhorteth, <hi>Let patience have its perfect worke, that we may be perfect and intire, lacking nothing, Jam.</hi> 1.4.</p>
                           <p>Chriſt was for a time forſaken of his Father, that he might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort himſelfe with patience; and ſo it is required of us, <hi>that in our afflictions we poſſeſſe our ſoules with patience, Luk.</hi> 21.19. for ſo we ſhall apply our ſelves to be found in Faith, and the love of God, and to be lacking in no duty which God requireth at our hands.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, when out of evill he brings good, and turnes the evils that are come upon us, to our greater good: for to this end God affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth his children; and therefore Chriſt ſaith not, deliver us from <hi>calamity,</hi> or <hi>tribulation,</hi> but from <hi>evill:</hi> for God in his wiſdome doth ſo diſpoſe of the afflictions of the godly, that they ſhall have cauſe to <hi>rejoyce, and glory in tribulations, Rom.</hi> 5.3. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>Now they have cauſe to rejoyce in their tribulations in two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>quando crux liberat à cruciatu,</hi> when the croſſe delivereth from anguiſh, or vexation: for ſo the Apoſtle ſaith; that <hi>God doth chaſten his children in this life, that they ſhould not be condemned with the world,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>quando crux convertitur in coronam,</hi> when their croſſe is turned into their crowne: for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the afflictions of the godly, which they ſuffer here, are but light and momentany, and yet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure unto us a ſurpaſsing, and everlaſting weight of glory, ſuch as cannot be expreſſed,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. And the ſame Apoſtle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18 ſaith, <hi>I have made my reckoning, and now find, that the afflictions of this life are not worthy, or comparable to the glory that ſhall be revealed in the world to come.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now we may not limit God to any one of theſe wayes of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; but our deſire muſt be, that he will deliver us from <hi>Evill,</hi> that way which ſeemeth beſt unto him.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, ſeeing it is Gods will that we ſhall undergoe the croſſe in this life, our prayer to God muſt be, that of the croſſes that were on mount <hi>Calvary, Luk.</hi> 23.33. ours may be like to Chriſts croſſe, that we may ſuffer innocently for the name of Chriſt: <hi>For this is thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, if a man for conſcience towards God endure griefe, and ſuffer wrong undeſerved,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if not <hi>innocently,</hi> yet that our ſuffering may be like the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48000:352"/>good theefe, that confeſſed he ſuffered worthily: for hee repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of his ſinne, and by faith conceived comfort, that albeit his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy were crucified, yet his ſoule ſhould be received with Chriſt into glory: but in any waies our deſire muſt be that we ſuffer not like the wicked and reprobate theefe, that blaſphemed Chriſt, and dyed without repentance.</p>
                           <p>The perſons to be delivered are expreſſed in the word <hi>nos,</hi> which implyeth a twofold reaſon, the one in regard of the word <hi>libera, We are thy ſervants, therefore make us free, and ſuffer us not to be ſlaves to Satan.</hi> So the Prophet reaſoneth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. &amp; 143.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, againe, deliver us, for we are thy <hi>children;</hi> thoſe whom thou haſt taught to call thee Father, therefore though we be <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiboſheths,</hi> for our deformity, and <hi>Abſolons</hi> for our ungraciouſneſſe, yet ſhew thy ſelfe a Father to us; and of ſervants, though we be not only <hi>unprofitable, Luk.</hi> 17. but <hi>evill</hi> and <hi>waſtfull, Luk.</hi> 16. yet becauſe we are thy ſervants, deliver us.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, we are thy workmanſhip, therefore <hi>deſpiſe not the workes of thine owne hands, Pſal.</hi> 138.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, <hi>We are thy Image, Gen.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>Fifthly, the <hi>price of thy Sonnes blood.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Sixthly, <hi>Veſſels to carry thy Name:</hi> we are they upon whom thy name is called, therefore deliver us, elſe wee ſhall be a <hi>reproach to them that are about us, Dan.</hi> 9.18.</p>
                           <p>Seventhly, we are the members of thy Church, which is the <hi>body of Chriſt Jeſus our Saviour, our head, Rom.</hi> 12.5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22.</p>
                           <p>The other reaſon is from the word <hi>mala,</hi> the devill as hee is our enemy, ſo he is Gods, and he hateth us, becauſe we are thine, and therefore laboureth to draw us from thee; but <hi>ſave thou us that wee fall not from thee,</hi> as he hath done.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>(us)</hi> for we may not pray for our ſelves alone, but for our brethren alſo, that God will be good to them likewiſe; and though we be out of trouble, yet becauſe we be of the body, we may truly ſay, deliver us, when we pray in the behalfe of our brethren that are under the croſſe.</p>
                           <p>Untill the <hi>laſt enemy, death, be deſtroyed,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. we ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be fully freed, but have one evill or other: Therefore we are to pray for that time, <hi>when we ſhall hunger and thirſt no more, when God ſhall wipe all teares from our eyes, Rev.</hi> 7.16. at the leaſt, if he take us not preſently out of the world, yet <hi>to keepe us from the evill of the world, Joh.</hi> 17.15. till that day, when there ſhall be <hi>no more death, nor ſorrow, nor crying, nor paine, Rev.</hi> 21.4. but God ſhall be in all to us for ever.</p>

                           <p>In the beginning we heard, that all <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Invocation</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but a <hi>teſtimony,</hi> and <hi>confeſſion.</hi> The Petitions that are ſeverally made in this Prayer, are; <hi>confeſſion</hi> of our <hi>weakneſſe, want, need,</hi> and <hi>unableneſſe to do any thing that may pleaſe God.</hi> The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and end of it are, <hi>an acknowledgement of Gods riches, power,</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> whereby he is inclined to ſupply our wants, for that hee is not onely willing, as a Father, but able as a King; ſo that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever prayer we make, whether <hi>Tekinnah</hi> or <hi>Tehillah;</hi> whether we pray that we <hi>may receive ſome good thing of God,</hi> or <hi>praiſe him for good received,</hi> is a <hi>confeſſion</hi> and both theſe confeſſions make for Gods glory; not only to him that was to make confeſſion of his ſin, it was ſaid, <hi>Da gloriam Deo, Joſh.</hi> 7.19. but the blind man that had received a benefit by the recovery of his ſight, was ſaid, <hi>to give glory to God, Joh.</hi> 19.24.</p>

                           <p>The <hi>beginning</hi> of this prayer was a <hi>confeſsion</hi> of Gods <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> the <hi>end</hi> of his <hi>power,</hi> for unto doing of good is required not onely willingneſſe, but power and ability.</p>
                           <p>To ſhew that God is willing, we are taught to call upon him by the name of Father; for any father is willing to do his child good, but with this willingneſſe, there muſt concurre an ability to do good, which howſoever it be wanting in earthly Fathers, yet it is not wanting in our heavenly Father: for whereas nothing doth more expreſſe power, then the name of a King, Chriſt acknowledgeth God to be ſuch a Father as hath <hi>Kingdome, power,</hi> and <hi>glory,</hi> and therefore is able to do us whatſoever good he will. So God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe affirmeth of himſelfe, <hi>I am a great King, Mal.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. he is called <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> ſo that if wee will pray to God the Father, wee have cauſe to conceive hope that hee will heare our Petitions, and help us, becauſe he is not onely <hi>willing,</hi> as a <hi>Father,</hi> but <hi>able,</hi> as a mighty, glorious, and powerfull <hi>Prince.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, if to God the <hi>Sonne,</hi> his dying for us doth aſſure us, of his good will and readineſſe to do us good, and his riſing againe from the dead, when he hath broken the yron barres, doth aſſure us of his power.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, if to the <hi>Holy Ghaſt,</hi> we ſhall not need to doubt of his willingneſſe, for he is the eſſentiall love of God, <hi>which is ſhed in our hearts, Rom.</hi> 5. Beſides he is the ſpirit operative, by whom God worketh all good things in the hearts of his people, and therefore able to do whatſoever good for us: and thoſe two, to wit, the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of Gods goodneſſe, and power, are the two parts of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of our hope, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.18, 19. and he gives us not onely <hi>auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciam petendi,</hi> but alſo <hi>fiduciam impetrandi,</hi> not only boldneſſe to aske, but alſo aſſurance to obtaine.</p>
                           <p>The make requeſts in our owne behalfe, and acknowlegement to God of his love and power, are both confeſſions, but the principall is the acknowledgment of his gooodneſſe, and Kingdome, &amp; power; for to make requeſt to God for good things that we want, concernes men, but to confeſſe Gods <hi>power</hi> and <hi>goodneſſe,</hi> is that wherein the heavenly Angels are occupied in, they feele no want of any good thing, and therefore they have no ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <hi>equall, or like to the Angels, Luk.</hi> 20. ought while we live on earth, not ſpeake only with the tongue of men, but of Angels, not onely to confeſſe our owne wants, and to crave a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from God, but to acknowledge Gods <hi>riches, goodneſſe,</hi> and <hi>power.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Againe, the Petitions that wee make for our ſelves, is a <hi>taking;</hi> and <hi>ſanctification of his name,</hi> by aſcribing <hi>Kingdome, power,</hi> and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48000:354"/>
                              <hi>glory,</hi> unto God, is a <hi>giving,</hi> and therefore as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is a more bleſſed thing to give, then to receive, Act.</hi> 29.35. So the <hi>confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of Gods <hi>goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>power,</hi> is a better confeſſion, then that which we make of our owne <hi>weakneſſe,</hi> and <hi>poverty;</hi> and this is the onely thing which God receives from us, for the manifold benefits that we receive from him.</p>
                           <p>Neither is this <hi>confeſsion</hi> and acknowledgement left to our owne choice as a thing indifferent, but we muſt account of it as of a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary duty, which may in no wiſe be omitted, ſeeing God enters into covenant, that he will heare us and deliver us out of trouble, <hi>when we call upon him, Pſal.</hi> 50. therefore God challengeth this a duty to himſelfe by his ſervants, <hi>Aſcribe unto the Lord worſhip and ſtrength, give unto the Lord the glory due unto his Name, Pſal.</hi> 29. <hi>All Nations whom thou haſt made ſhall come and worſhip thee, and glorifie thy name, Pſal.</hi> 86.9.</p>
                           <p>Therefore our Saviour commends the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to give glory to God for the benefit received; wherein he blames the other nine, that being cleanſed of their leproſie <hi>were not thankfull to God,</hi> in that behalfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17. For God, for this cauſe doth heare our prayers, and grant our Petitions, that we ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie and honour his name.</p>
                           <p>But this is not all that we are to conſider in theſe words, for they are not onely <gap reason="foreign">

                              </gap>, not onely an aſtipulation, but an allegation, wherein as we acknowledge Gods goodneſſe and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that hath heard and granted our requeſts, ſo wee alledge reaſons, why he ſhould not onely <hi>heare us,</hi> but alſo <hi>relieve</hi> and helpe us with thoſe things that wee crave for at his hands: wee do not onely ſay, <hi>heare our Petitions,</hi> for ſo ſhalt thou ſhew thy ſelfe to be a King, but a mighty and glorious King, and we for our parts ſhall acknowledge the ſame; but we uſe this confeſſion as a reaſon, why our former requeſts are to be granted; for it is in effect as much as if we ſhould ſay; <hi>Forgive thou our ſinnes: deliver thou us from evill: hallowed be thy Name: thy Kingdome come, for Kingdome, power, and glory is thine, and not ours.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The reaſon why we would have our requeſts granted, is drawne from God himſelfe in two reſpects: firſt, that we may by this humble confeſſion make our ſelves capable of the graces of God, which do not deſcend to any but thoſe that are of an humble ſpirit, <hi>For he gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth grace to the humble,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.</p>
                           <p>If we would have our deſires granted, becauſe it is the nature of God to be good and gracious; to be of power, to do what hee will for the good of his people, we muſt deſire him to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>propter ſemetipſum, Eſay</hi> 43.25. Our motive unto God muſt be, <hi>For thy loving mercy, and thy truths ſake, Pſalm.</hi> 115.1. <hi>Helpe us for the glory of thy Name, deliver us, be mercifull unto our ſinnes, for thy Names ſake, Pſal.</hi> 79.9. By theſe motives we muſt provoke, and ſtirre vp God to heare us. This is the difference that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the prayers of profane men, and thoſe that are ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Heathen and profane men referre all to their owne glory, ſo
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:48000:354"/>ſaies <hi>Nabuchadnezzar, Is not this great Babell which I have built by my great power, and for the honour of my Majeſty? Dan.</hi> 4.30. Such a man thinkes himſelfe to be abſolute Lord, and will ſay, <hi>Who is the Lord over us? Pſal.</hi> 12. Therefore are they called the ſonnes of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liall:</hi> But the Patriarches that were ſanctified, frame their prayers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: <hi>Jacob</hi> acknowledged, <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of thy mercies, Gen.</hi> 32. by which humility he made himſelfe capable of mercy. <hi>To us belongeth ſhame</hi> (ſaith <hi>Daniel,</hi> chap. 9.) <hi>but to thee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs compaſſion and forgiveneſſe, though we have offended:</hi> So Chriſt himſelfe in this place doth teach his Diſciples to pray, that God will give them the things they deſire, not for any thing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but for his names ſake: for <hi>thine is Kingdome, Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> whereby wee perceive that humility is the meanes to obtaine at Gods hands our ſuites.</p>
                           <p>The other reſpect is in regard of God, for he makes his covenant with us, <hi>that he will be our God, and we his people.</hi> And when the Prophet ſtirreth up the faithfull, <hi>to worſhip the Lord, and to fall downe before the Lord our maker:</hi> hee addeth this as a reaſon, <hi>For he is the Lord our God, and we are his people, and the ſheepe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, Pſal.</hi> 95. Wherefore one ſaith, <hi>Commemoratio, eſt quaedam ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitas exaudiendi nos, quia nos ipſius ſumus, ipſe noſter eſt:</hi> It is a neceſſary motive to God to heare us, becauſe we are his, and he ours.</p>
                           <p>Therefore in all the Prayers and Pſalmes which the Saints of God make, they ground their Petitions upon this: in regard of God the Father, who is the Creator, they ſay, <hi>Wee are thy work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip created by thee, therefore deſpiſe not the workes of thy owne hands, Pſal.</hi> 138. Beſides, <hi>wee are the likeneſſe of Gods Image, Gen.</hi> 1. therefore ſuffer not thine owne Image to be defaced in us, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire it.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, in regard of Chriſt, <hi>Wee are the price of Chriſts bloud. Empti eſtis pretio,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor. 6. Yee are bought with a price, therefore ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer not ſo great a price to be loſt, but deliver us and ſave us.</hi> Againe, <hi>We carry his Name,</hi> for as he is Chriſt, ſo wee are of him called Chriſtians: <hi>ſeeing therefore that his name is called upon us, Dan.</hi> 9.19. <hi>be gracious to us, and grant our requeſts.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, in reſpect of the Holy Spirit, the breath of his Spirit is in our noſtrills, which is the breath of life which God <hi>breathed in us at our creation, Gen.</hi> 2.7. Againe, the ſame Spirit is to us an Holy Spirit, and ſanctifieth us, wee are not onely <hi>Vaginae Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritus viventis,</hi> the ſheaths of the living Spirit; but <hi>Templa Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus ſancti: The Temples of the holy Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 6.19. And therefore for his ſake wee are to intreat him to be gracious to us.</p>
                           <p>Wee are Gods Kingdome, and therefore it belongeth to him to ſeeke our good: all the world is his kingdome by right of inheritance; but we that are his <hi>Church,</hi> are his Kingdome by right of purchaſe: wee are <gap reason="foreign">

He ſaith, <hi>He will be our God, and wee his people, Levit.</hi> 26. <hi>Hee will be our Father, and wee his Children,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. he our Lord, and we his ſervants: Therefore we may challenge at his hands that favour which Kings vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to their ſubjects, which Fathers ſhew to their children: that is, to <hi>love them,</hi> to <hi>defend them,</hi> and to wiſh them all the good things they need.</p>
                           <p>If he have purchaſed us to himſelfe by his blood, then wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to him, and we may ſay to him as his Diſciples ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>Mark.</hi> 4.38. <hi>Careſt thou not for us</hi> that pertaine to thee, <hi>but ſuffereſt us to periſh?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Theſe words, <hi>Kingdome, Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> being joyntly conſidered, are a repreſentation of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſpeaking of the Author of our creation, reckons up the name of God three times, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. as in the bleſſings of the Law, the name of God is there repeated, <hi>Numb.</hi> 6.6. and as the Angels cry there, <hi>Holy, Holy, Holy, Eſay</hi> 6. to teach that there are three Perſons in the God-head, which the <hi>Heathen</hi> themſelves have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed; So Chriſt in the New Teſtament doth by theſe words, <hi>Kingdome, Power,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> ſignifie thoſe three Perſons, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward he expreſſeth by the name of <hi>Father, Sonne,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt, Matth.</hi> 28.</p>
                           <p>If we conſider them ſeverally, although they may all be aſcribed to any Perſon of the Deity, yet the <hi>Kingdome is to be aſcribed unto Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.35. <hi>Power, to the Holy Ghoſt, Rom.</hi> 15.13.19. and <hi>Glory, to the Father, Rom.</hi> 6.4. that wee ſetting our ſelves in Chriſts Kingdome, that is, his Church, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, may be partakers of that glory which God the Father hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for us.</p>
                           <p>Againe, theſe words are ſet to diſtinguiſh Gods Kingdome from earthly kingdomes. Each King hath not power, as the King of Iſrael ſaith: <hi>If the Lord do not ſuccour thee, how can I helpe thee?</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 6.21. But Gods Kingdome is a Kingdome of power.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, there are Kingdomes of <hi>Might,</hi> but not of <hi>Glory:</hi> ſuch was the Kingdome of <hi>David,</hi> hee had a Kingdome of <hi>Might,</hi> but not of <hi>Glory:</hi> for hee ſpent all his time in troubles; but the Kingdome of <hi>Solomon</hi> his ſonne, was both a <hi>powerfull,</hi> and a <hi>Glorious</hi> kingdome, and there was a figure of the perfect Kingdome of Chriſt.</p>
                           <p>Wherefore we are taught by theſe words, that as the Kingdome is the Lords, ſo he hath not onely a Kingdome of power, whereby he is able to defend, but of glory, whereby he can alſo reward his ſervants and ſubjects: <hi>Moſes</hi> deſired of God, <hi>that hee would ſhew him his glory, Exod.</hi> 33. But hee that is of Chriſts Kingdome, <hi>ſhall ſee the glory which Chriſt had from the beginning with the Father, Joh.</hi> 17.21.</p>
                           <p>To conſider theſe words ſeverally: upon theſe words of the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:48000:355"/>Prophet, <hi>Knit my heart unto thee, Pſalm.</hi> 86. one ſaith, <hi>Religio dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur à religando:</hi> as there is a mutuall bond betweene the King and his people; ſo is there betweene God and us. The Kings du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to defend his ſubjects from injury and wrong, and to beſtow on them all manner of benefits. The duty of ſubjects is to be duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and yeeld all ready ſervice to their Prince: ſo God for his part is ready, not onely to defend us from all danger, but to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all good things upon us: and therefore wee are bound to be religious and dutifull to him, as to our King and Soveraigne: wee muſt not onely <hi>love</hi> him, as a <hi>Father,</hi> but <hi>feare</hi> him, as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King, Matth.</hi> 1.6. And this mixture ſhall keepe us in the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wee ſhall neither too much deſpaire, nor preſume of his goodneſſe; this feare we muſt teſtifie both by a reverend regard of his Law, and of his Officers. Hee is no good ſubject that rebelleth againſt the lawes of his Prince; no more are we, when no more can be gotten at our hands, but by the precepts of men, <hi>Eſay,</hi> 29. when the <hi>ſtatutes of Omri</hi> are kept for feare of temporall puniſhment, <hi>Mich.</hi> 6. and the lawes of God are had in no price, then it is a ſigne that we are not ſo dutifull and loyall to our heavenly Prince, as wee ought to be.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, we muſt teſtifie our feare of God, by a reverend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of his Prophets and Prieſts, which are the Miniſters and Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in his kingdome. When the Jewes <hi>mocked the meſſengers of God, and miſ-uſed his Prophets,</hi> they ſhewed their contempt of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe; and therefore the wrath of the Lord aroſe againſt that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. Contrariwiſe, if wee have an honourable conceit of them, and <hi>receive them as the Angels of God, Gal.</hi> 4. then we ſhew our ſelves to be dutifull vaſſalls to our heavenly Lord and King.</p>
                           <p>Next, for <hi>power,</hi> as S. <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>God is able both to reſpect the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and to ſhew vengeance upon the wicked,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. So whether we reſpect the power of his grace <hi>inward,</hi> whereby hee worketh all good things in the hearts of his people, or the <hi>outward power,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by hee defends them from evill: whether it be the power of his <hi>holy Spirit,</hi> or of his <hi>right hand,</hi> wee muſt confeſſe with the Saints <hi>that all power, and ſtrength, and might belongs to God, Rev.</hi> 7. And therefore whatſoever power we have, whether <hi>inward</hi> or <hi>outward,</hi> we muſt imploy it all in his ſervice. <hi>Fortitudinem meam ad te ſervo, I will keepe my ſtrength, or reſerve it unto thee, Pſal.</hi> 59.9. So we muſt not ſpend our ſtrength in thoughts of vanity, but imploy it to his uſe, and to the ſetting forth of his glory, to whom onely all power belongeth.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, Chriſt teacheth us to aſcribe all glory to God, that whatſoever praiſe or commendation doth come unto us by any thing we do, wee ſhould make a ſurrender of it to God, to whom all glory is due, and ſay with the Church, <hi>Non nobis Domine, &amp;c. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy Name give all glory, Pſal.</hi> 115. For as the Prophet ſaith, The Church is a place wherein
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48000:356"/>the voyce of gladneſſe is heard, and the voyce of them that ſing, <hi>Praiſe the Lord of Hoſts, for he is loving, and his mercy endures for ever, Jer.</hi> 33.11.</p>
                           <p>The faithfull are taught to returne all glory to God, which is given to them. God himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Gloriam meam alteri non daho, Eſay</hi> 42. If he gives his glory to any other, it is to ſuch as deſerve it, and have all power of themſelves; but there is no creature which hath any power, but what is given of God, and therefore God doth by right reſerve his glory to himſelfe, and wee ought willingly yeeld all glory to him alone, becauſe he promiſeth, <hi>them that honour mee, I will honour,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. that we glorifying him here with a <hi>verball glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> we may be glorified of him with a <hi>reall glory,</hi> when he <hi>commeth to judge the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.12. <hi>and with an exceeding weight of glory,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.</p>
                           <p>But yet wee do not fully ſee wherein the glorious Kingdome of God differs from the kingdomes of this world: for both power, and glory may be aſcribed to an earthly Prince; and it is certaine, that <hi>Solomon</hi> had them all: and therefore as hee is diſtinguiſhed from earthly fathers, for that he is ſaid to be in heaven: ſo he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from earthly Kings, in that his Kingdome is ſaid, <hi>to endure for ever and ever.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is another difference implyed in the Article; earthly Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have <hi>a Kingdome,</hi> a Kingdome of power, and a certaine glory in this world, but it is not <hi>the</hi> Kingdome.</p>
                           <p>This prepoſitive Article imports two things, a <hi>Generality</hi> and a <hi>Superiority:</hi> for the firſt point, he that hath but a peece of the earth to beare rule in, is not an univerſall King; but <hi>God is King over all the earth, Pſal.</hi> 47. Therefore if wee be ſo carefull to behave our ſelves aright in the preſence of an earthly King, whoſe Kingdome is limited within certaine bounds, which if hee exceed, he is no more King; much more ought we to praiſe and glorifie him, whoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is univerſall.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, for the ſuperiority of Gods Kingdome, there are a great number of Kings on earth: but of this Kingdome it is ſaid: <hi>All Kings ſhall fall downe before him, all Nations ſhall worſhip him, Pſalm</hi> 72. <hi>For hee is ſaid to be King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, Rev.</hi> 19.</p>
                           <p>Touching the other difference ſignified by the word <hi>(for ever.)</hi> Though a man had all the earth for his Kingdome, yet it could not be a Kingdome for <hi>ever</hi> and <hi>ever:</hi> no Prince ever raigned the whole age of a man, and ſo long time as a man naturally may live, which the Philoſophers ſay, is the ſpace of an hundred yeares; but his Kingdome indures not onely the age of a man, but <hi>In ſeculum, For ever:</hi> Thy Kingdome, Power and Glory endureth for <hi>ever and ever,</hi> whereas mans Kingdome, Power, and glory, laſteth but a few yeares, and ſometimes but a few dayes.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Jezabel</hi> had a glorious Kingdome, but within a few yeares it was ſaid of her, <hi>Ubi eſt illa Jezabel?</hi> 2 <hi>Reg.</hi> 10. when it was fulfilled
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48000:356"/>which the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> foretold, 13.28. <hi>Tell the King and Queene: Humble your ſelves, for your dignity ſhall be taken away, and the crowne of your glory ſhall fall downe.</hi> And the like is the greatneſſe of all earthly Kingdomes: and therefore Chriſt teacheth us to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect our Petitions to him, <hi>whoſe Kingdome is everlaſting, Pſalm.</hi> 145. <hi>whoſe power endureth for ever and ever:</hi> not to a mortall King, but to God, <hi>Qui ſolus habet &amp;c. which onely hath immortality,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. who being himſelfe an everlaſting King, and incorruptible, is able to beſtow upon us both a <hi>Crowne,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. and an <hi>inheritance incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and that fadeth not,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. This is our hope and the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our deſires, and therefore as the Creed hath his period in <hi>Life everlaſting,</hi> ſo laſt of all we are taught to pray for <hi>Glory everlaſting.</hi>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are now come to the laſt word of the Lords Prayer, the power and efficacie whereof at this time is to be conſidered, for there is in it every way, matter worthy of our conſideration; and wee cannot perfectly accompliſh our duty in prayer, except we underſtand this word aright: For after we have laid out our ſeverall petitions to God, and made our allegation to God, why we deſire to be reſpected by him; namely, <hi>becauſe we are of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,</hi> and Juriſdiction, for that we have <hi>no power of our ſelves</hi> to do any thing; Laſtly, becauſe that we confeſſe, that <hi>all glory is to be aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him;</hi> then it remaineth that we deſire of God, that thoſe Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and allegations made by us, may by him be ratified, which is done in the word <hi>Amen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Wherein the ancient Writers conſider two things: Firſt, <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, it is <hi>Signaculum conſenſus noſtri,</hi> that by it we acknowledge that whatſoever we can deſire is contained in this forme of prayer.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith, it is <hi>votum deſiderii noſtri,</hi> that as wee allow of this forme of Prayer, and the Petitions made therein: ſo we deſire that it will pleaſe God to performe, and accompliſh them: ſo in this word is implyed the conſent of our minde to allow of the things which we are taught to pray for in this Prayer: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the deſire of our heart for the obtaining of the ſame.</p>
                           <p>The one is the <hi>ſeale</hi> of our <hi>faith,</hi> in as much as wee acknowledge thoſe things to be true. The other is the <hi>ſeale</hi> of our <hi>love,</hi> whereby we teſtifie our deſire for the accompliſhment of theſe Petitions. The one is referred to <hi>Truth,</hi> the other to the <hi>fervencie of the ſpirit:</hi> in which two things, as our Saviour affirmeth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.24. <hi>the right worſhip of God conſiſteth:</hi> concerning which word, to be added in the end of our ſupplications, there is an abſolute commandement, not only in the old Teſtament, <hi>Let al the people ſay</hi> Amen, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.33. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 106. but in the New, as appeareth by S. <hi>Pauls</hi> queſtion, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. who to ſhew the neceſſity of this word, he ſaith, <hi>How ſhall the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:48000:357"/>unlearned ſay A men to thy thankſgiving?</hi> for indeed it concerneth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, as he will anſwer the tranſgreſſion of <hi>dicet omnis populus,</hi> all the people ſhall ſay, which is a flat commandement, not to be omitted, to adde this word to their prayer. The word it ſelfe is ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>Hebrew,</hi> but uſed by the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> and retained ſtill in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry language and tongue, without tranſlation, or alteration, either in <hi>Greeke, Latine,</hi> or any other; the reaſon of the retaining of it is, that is might appeare, that the <hi>Synagogue</hi> of the children of Iſraell, and the true congregation of the Church of Chriſt, gathered out of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, is but one myſticall body, whereof <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the head: the ſame we are given to underſtand, by this, that the Spirit of Adoption is ſaid to cry non onely <hi>Abba,</hi> in the hearts of the Jewes, but alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap> and <hi>Father,</hi> in <hi>the hearts of the Gentiles, Rom.</hi> 8.20. Therefore our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour would not have his name to be either intirely Hebrew, as <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Meſsias,</hi> or intirely Greeke, as <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>, but the one in Hebrew, the other in Greeke, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> to ſhew that he is our peace, who of two hath made one, that hath reconciled us both in one body, and that he is the corner ſtone, whereby the Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting both of Jewes and Gentiles, <hi>is coupled together, and groweth to be one holy Temple to the Lord, Eph.</hi> 2.14. Though they be as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeakes, <hi>Congregatio primogenitorum, Heb.</hi> 12.23. yet we are the Church of God as well as they; we, I ſay, that are borne after them: we, that are of the Gentiles, have none other law for our direction, then that which the Jewes had, as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I write no new commandemem, but an old commandement, which you have heard from the beginning,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.7. Wee have no other faith, but as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>eundem ſpiritum fidei habentes;</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. The ſame grace is offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to us, that was offered to the Fathers, <hi>for we beleeve to be ſaved by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt, as well as they, Act.</hi> 15.11. and wee have no other Sacraments, then thoſe which the Jewes had, of whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>They all did eate the ſame ſpirituall meat, and dranke the ſame ſpirituall drinke,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. and therefore it is meete like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that we ſhould make the ſame prayer that they made: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed there is no Petition in the Lords Prayer, which is not found in the Old Teſtament, uſed by the Church of the Jewes. For, that which the Prophet prayeth, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 57.6. <hi>Lift up thy ſelfe, O God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the heavens, and thy glory above all the earth, Pſal.</hi> 67. <hi>That thy way may be knowne upon earth, &amp;c.</hi> is nothing elſe, but the hallowing of Gods Name.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, <hi>Remember mee O God, that I may ſee the felicity of thy cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, Pſal.</hi> 106. It is nothing elſe but an expoſition of the ſecond Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, where we pray, <hi>Thy Kingdome come.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Thirdly, theſe words of the Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. <hi>Teach mee to do the thing that pleaſeth thee,</hi> is a full comprehenſion of the third Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, where we deſire that his will be done.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, the <hi>eyes of all things do looke upon thee, and thou giveſt them meat in due ſeaſon, Pſal.</hi> 145. and the prayer of <hi>Solomon, Prov.</hi> 30. <hi>Give mee not poverty, nor riches, but feed mee with food meete,</hi> is a full expreſſing of the fourth Petition.</p>
                           <pb n="132" facs="tcp:48000:358"/>
                           <p>Fifthly, <hi>My miſdeeds prevaile againſt mee; O be mercifull to our ſinnes, Pſal.</hi> 65.3. is a ſumme of the fifth petition, and the condition of this Petition is found, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7. wherein the Prophet ſaith, <hi>If I have done any ſuch thing, or if there be any wickedneſſe in my hands; If I have rewarded evill to him that dealt friendly with mee (yea I have delivered him that without a cauſe was my enemy) then let my enemy perſecute my ſoule;</hi> whereby he deſireth no otherwiſe to be forgiven of God, then as he doth forgive his brother.</p>
                           <p>Sixthly, that which the Prophet prayeth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.37. <hi>Turne away my eyes, that they behold not vanity,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143. <hi>Set a watch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my mouth, and keepe the doore of my lips,</hi> is that which Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us to pray, <hi>Lead us not into temptation.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Seventhly, <hi>Redeeme Iſrael from all trouble, Pſal.</hi> 25.20. in affect is as much as, <hi>Deliver them from all evill,</hi> which is the ſeventh Petition.</p>
                           <p>Laſtly, looke what reaſon Chriſt teacheth us to uſe here, the ſame doth <hi>David</hi> uſe, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.</p>
                           <p>Therefore having the ſame prayer that the Jewes had, it is meet that wee ſhould have the ſame concluſion that they had, and the ſame is, they ſaid <hi>Amen,</hi> and ſo do wee.</p>
                           <p>Touching the uſe of this word, it is found in Scriptures to have two <hi>ſeats</hi> or <hi>places,</hi> and accordingly two ſeverall <hi>expoſitions,</hi> to wit in the <hi>beginning,</hi> and in the <hi>end, before,</hi> and <hi>behind.</hi> In the <hi>beginning,</hi> as in the doctrine of the Sacrament of Baptiſme, concerning which our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Amen, Amen, except a man be borne of the water, and of the Spirit, hee cannot enter into the Kingdome of God, Joh.</hi> 3. And touching the Sacrament of the holy Euchariſt, <hi>Verily, verily, except yee eate the fleſh of the Sonne of man, and drinke his blood, yee have no life in you, Joh.</hi> 6.33. And touching the effect of prayer, Chriſt ſaith alſo, <hi>Verily, verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever yee ſhall aske the Father in my name, hee will give it you, Joh.</hi> 16.</p>
                           <p>In thoſe places, the word <hi>(Amen)</hi> is uſed, and thereby our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour laboureth to expreſſe the truth of that which he doth teach. In the <hi>end</hi> likewiſe it is ſaid, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.13. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 87.50. <hi>Praiſed be the Lord for evermore, Amen, Amen.</hi> And in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, when the Apoſtle ſheweth, <hi>That of the Jewes according to the fleſh came Chriſt, who is over all, God bleſſed for ever, Amen, Rom.</hi> 9.5. Here the word is uſed, and ſet behind, to ſignifie that wee deſire that that may be performed, which God before by his <hi>Amen</hi> hath affirmed to be true. Therefore <hi>David,</hi> having received promiſe from the Lord, by the hand of <hi>Nathan,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let the thing that thou haſt promiſed be Amen.</hi> Let there be an accompliſhment of the ſame, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.25. So when the Prophet <hi>Hananiah</hi> had propheſied in the name of the Lord; <hi>I have broken the yoke of the King of Babell, and after two yeares will I bring againe, into this place, all the ornaments of the houſe of the Lord: Jeremy</hi> the Prophet ſaid, <hi>Amen, the Lord do as thou haſt ſaid, Jer.</hi> 28.6.</p>
                           <p>As in the <hi>beginning</hi> it ratifieth the truth of Gods promiſe, ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet in the <hi>end,</hi> it ſignifieth the deſire of our hearts for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the ſame, and this deſire alwaies followeth, and is
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48000:358"/>grounded upon the promiſe of God, and the truth thereof: In which regard the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Remember me O Lord concerning thy word, wherein thou cauſeſt me to put my truſt, Pſal.</hi> 119. and therefore, to Chriſts <hi>A non,</hi> in the beginning, where he promiſeth, <hi>Verily, verily, whatſoever ye aske in my name, Iohn</hi> 16. we may boldly adde our <hi>Amen</hi> in the <hi>end,</hi> that his <hi>Amen</hi> may be performed; and by right doe we ground our <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> upon Gods <hi>Amen,</hi> for he is called <hi>Amen,</hi> that is truth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 65.16. So the Apoſtle expreſſeth it, when ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſaith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>Thus ſaith Amen, the fault fall and true witneſſe, Revel.</hi> 3.14.</p>
                           <p>Therefore S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of Chriſt, <hi>that in him all the promiſes are made to us, yea,</hi> in the beginning, <hi>and Amen,</hi> to us in regard of the certaine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
                           <p>The reaſon of our <hi>Amen</hi> is, becauſe not onely faith, but truſt and confidence doth proceed from the <hi>truth</hi> of God: <hi>fides,</hi> hath relation to Gods truth, but <hi>fiducia,</hi> or confidence, is ſetled upon Gods faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and both are affirmed of God.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith of God that he is, <hi>verus</hi> and <hi>fidelis, Deut.</hi> 32. and <hi>Eſay, The Lord is faithfull, Eſa.</hi> 49.7, 8. <hi>Paul</hi> in the new Teſtament, <hi>Hee is faithfull that promiſed, Heb.</hi> 10. <hi>He deemed him faithfull that promiſed, Heb.</hi> 11. For there are two things required in faithfulneſſe, without the which a man cannot be ſaid to be faithfull: the one is <hi>ability,</hi> of which <hi>Abraham</hi> doubted not of Gods faithfulneſſe, being fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, <hi>That what he promiſed, he was able to performe, Rom.</hi> 4.21. the other is <hi>will</hi> and readineſſe to doe, touching which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Faithfull is he that called you, &amp; ipſe faciet,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.24.</p>
                           <p>Theſe are the parts of faithfulneſſe, and they are both found in God, and therefore not onely God the Father is true, but <hi>Chriſt</hi> is ſaid to be the <hi>truth, Iohn</hi> 14. and the holy Ghoſt is called the <hi>Spirit of truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.6. So that albeit men deale ſo untruly that it is verified of them; <hi>ad men are lyers, Rom.</hi> 3. Yet <hi>God abides faithfull, and cannot deny<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>h myſelfe,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.13.</p>
                           <p>So much the Prophet teacheth, when he ſaith; the <hi>mountaines ſhall be removed, but the thing which be hath ſpoken ſhall not faile, Eſa.</hi> 58. And our Saviour faith, <hi>Heaven and Earth ſhall paſſe, but one joy of my word ſhall not paſſe, Matth.</hi> 5.18. that is, in regard of his power and ability.</p>
                           <p>For the other part of his faithfulneſſe, which is his <hi>will</hi> and readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, he is ſaid <hi>to be a faithfull Creator, that will have care of the ſoules committed to him,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. and to this purpoſe ſerveth that which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> affirmeth; <hi>Behold what love the Father hath ſhowed us, that we ſhould bee Sonnes of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>There is in God that <hi>faithfulneſſe</hi> that is in a mother towards her children, for as a woman cannot but pity her owne child, and the ſon of her womb, ſo the Lord will not <hi>forget his owne people, Iſa.</hi> 45.15. As his arme is not ſhortned, but is ſtill able to helpe; ſo his affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us is ſuch, that he is moſt willing to helpe.</p>
                           <p>In this regard, as hath beene obſerved, he is both a <hi>King</hi> and a <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> the one ſhewing his power, the other his willingneſſe and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will towards us; upon both theſe we doe ground our <hi>Amen,</hi> and doe learne, not onely, <hi>Credere vero,</hi> beleeve God which is <hi>true,</hi> but <hi>fidere
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48000:359"/>fideli,</hi> truſt him which is <hi>faithfull,</hi> upon this faithfulneſſe we may ground all our Petitions, if we ſeeke forgiveneſſe of our treſpaſſes, as Chriſt teacheth us to pray, then <hi>God is faithfull to forgive us our ſinnes,</hi> 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. If we will pray againſt tentation, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God is faithfull, and will not ſuffer us to be tempted above that we are able to beare,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. If to be delivered from evill, which is the laſt Petition, the Apoſtle tels us, <hi>The Lord is faithfull, and will ſtabliſh us, and keep us from all evill,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.</p>
                           <p>Thus we ſee, both what is our <hi>Amen,</hi> and whereupon it is grounded.</p>
                           <p>The laſt thing is, the right ſaying of this word, which is a thing to be inquired, for the Apoſtle as though he tooke care for the right ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, ſaith, <hi>How ſhall the unlearned ſay Amen?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.16. Teaching us, that it is not enough to ſay <hi>Amen,</hi> unleſſe it be ſaid in right forme and manner.</p>
                           <p>The right ſaying is reduced to foure things: Firſt, that as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſayes, <hi>We pray with the Spirit,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. For of the foure evill <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens,</hi> which the Hebrewes note, one is, when our <hi>Amen</hi> doth not come from an earneſt deſire, <hi>We muſt powre out our hearts before him, Pſal.</hi> 62.8. So our <hi>Amen</hi> muſt come from the heart: we muſt be ſo diſpoſed, that we may ſay: <hi>As the Hart brayeth for the rivers of waters, ſo thirsteth my ſoule after thee O God, Pſal.</hi> 42.1. <hi>My ſoule thirſteth for thee, and my fleſh longeth for thee in a barren and dry land where no water is, Pſal.</hi> 63. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this <hi>Amen,</hi> our <hi>Amen</hi> is <hi>evanime, a dead Amen.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, a man may deſire a falſe thing, ſo did the Prophet give his <hi>Amen</hi> to the falſe prophecie of <hi>Hananiah, Ier.</hi> 28. but wee muſt bee carefull that it be true that we pray for, therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He will not pray with the Spirit onely, but with his underſtanding alſo,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.25. So our Saviour tels us, <hi>We muſt worſhip God, not in Spirit onely, but in Spirit and Truth:</hi> That is, we muſt have underſtanding that our Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons be true and agreeable to Gods will, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4. for as in thankſgiving it is requiſite, <hi>that we ſing praiſe with underſtanding, Pſal.</hi> 47. So the like muſt be done in prayer; they are both good; both to pray with the Spirit and with the mind, therefore it is better to pray with both, then with but one alone. Therefore it is a marvell that any ſhould thinke it enough to pray with the Spirit, though they doe not know in their mind what they pray for, but pray in an unknown tongue, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth; ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>He will pray both with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and with the underſtanding,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. and this underſtanding is not of the <hi>words onely,</hi> but of the <hi>matter</hi> that we pray for.</p>
                           <p>We may underſtand the words wherein the prayer is made, and yet not underſtand the thing that is prayed for.</p>
                           <p>The ſonnes of <hi>Zebedee</hi> prayed in their owne Language, and yet our Saviour tels them, <hi>Yee know not what yee aske.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Eunuch that was reading the Prophet <hi>Eſay,</hi> no doubt, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Language of the Prophet, and yet when <hi>Philip</hi> asked him: <hi>Vnderſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?</hi> he anſwered, <hi>How can I, except I had a guide? Acts</hi> 8.31. Therefore we muſt pray, not onely <hi>Intelligenter,</hi> but <hi>Scienter:</hi> we muſt know what we aske, wee muſt be carefull, that whatſoever we aske, <hi>be according to his will:</hi> for then may we be aſſured that he will heare us, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. we muſt aske in Chriſts name, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.</p>
                           <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48000:359"/>
                           <p>Laſtly, <hi>to a good end:</hi> for otherwayes our prayers ſhall not be heard: <hi>Yee aske and receive not, becauſe yee aske amiſſe, Iames</hi> 4. But this is not all that is required, that we may pray with the <hi>Minde</hi> and <hi>Vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding:</hi> for we muſt intend the thing that wee pray for with out heart, that the Lord may not have cauſe to complaine of us, as of the Jewes, <hi>that honoured him with their lips, while their heart was farre from him, Iſa.</hi> 29.14. That we may with more attention of heart addreſſe our ſelves to pray, our Saviour bids us to gather our ſelves from all things that may carry away, or diſtract our minds, and to <hi>enter into our chamber,</hi> there to pray <hi>to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>

This did not Saint <hi>Peter</hi> obſerve, when he prayed: <hi>Maſter, let us make here three Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles:</hi> and therefore the Evangeliſt ſaith, <hi>He knew not what he ſaid, Lake</hi> 9.33.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly, that we may ſay <hi>Amen</hi> aright, we muſt not onely under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand in our mind, and deſire in our ſpirit the thing that wee pray for, but muſt confidently looke for the performance of that we deſire: for unto this confidence there is a promiſe made on Gods part, of whom the Prophet ſaith, <hi>That the Lord is nigh to all that call upon him in truth, Pſal.</hi> 145. that is, in faith and confidence, that they ſhall obtaine the thing that they pray for: therefore our Saviour ſaith, <hi>whatſoever yee pray for bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>eve, and it ſhall be done, Marke</hi> 11.24. and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we will obtaine our requeſts, we muſt aske in faith, without wave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring: or elſe we ſhall be like the waves of the ſea, that are toſſed with the wind, and carried about with violence, Iames</hi> 1.6. And we ſhall not need to doubt, but we ſhall be heard, if we pray in a <hi>right manner,</hi> if we pray for a <hi>right end,</hi> that we may ſay, <hi>Tua est gloria.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This confidence and truſt hath certaine <hi>Limitations:</hi> firſt, wee may aſſure our ſelves, that God will grant our requeſts, if it be expedient for us: and therefore we muſt not limit God, nor appoint him his time, but as the Pſalmiſt ſaith, <hi>We muſt direct our prayers early to him, and wait for his pleaſure, Pſal.</hi> 5.3. <hi>We muſt tarry our Lords leaſure, Pſal.</hi> 27.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, though he grant not the ſame thing we deſire, yet he will grant us a better. The Apoſtle prayed Chriſt, <hi>that the pricke in the fleſh, the meſſenger of Satan, might be taken from him:</hi> but he had another an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer: <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> that was better, then if God had ſaid, <hi>Apage Satanas,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. For if we pray to God in ſuch manner and ſort as he requireth, we may aſſure our ſelves, <hi>our prayers ſhall not returne into our own boſomes, Pſal.</hi> 35.3. But he will either grant the thing we deſire, or elſe that which ſhall be better for us.</p>
                           <p>Fourthly, that our <hi>Amen</hi> be <hi>indiviſible,</hi> that is, we muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to every Petition of the Lords prayer: for naturally our corruption is ſuch, that we can be content to deſire the accompliſhment of ſome of them, but not of others: we doe willingly ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to <hi>Thy Kingdome come;</hi> but as for <hi>Hallowed be thy name,</hi> we give no <hi>Amen</hi> to that, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares by the whole courſe of our life, which is nothing elſe but a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning</hi> and <hi>polluting</hi> of Gods moſt <hi>glorious</hi> and <hi>fearfull</hi> Name.</p>
                           <p>We would gladly pray for <hi>daily bread,</hi> but as for doing of <hi>Gods will,</hi> and obeying his Commandements, we agree not to that.</p>
                           <p>We like well of the laſt Petition, <hi>Deliver us from evill,</hi> but as for that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48000:360"/>goes before it, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> we will not ſubſcribe to that: for we doe ſeeke by all meanes to tempt our ſelves, and to draw our ſelves unto ſinne.</p>
                           <p>We can be content to pray, <hi>that he will forgive us our treſpaſſes,</hi> but as for the condition, which is, the <hi>forgiving of thoſe that treſpaſſe againſt us,</hi> we give no <hi>Amen</hi> to that, as is cleere by the wrathfull and revenging ſpirit that carrieth moſt men into all manner of outrages, while they will not learne to put up wrong, as they are taught by Gods word. Therefore in regard of this Petition, and the condition annexed, our Saviour ſaith: <hi>Take heed</hi> ye ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to this intirely: <hi>except ye forgive one another, your heavenly Father will not forgive you, Matth.</hi> 6.15.</p>
                           <p>Therefore we muſt have a care as well to <hi>hallow</hi> Gods none in this life, as to be partakers of his Kingdome in the life to come: we muſt labour as well for the <hi>fulfilling of his will,</hi> as for the <hi>obtaining of daily bread.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>If we will be freed from evill, which is the effect of ſinne, we muſt take heed that we doe not <hi>tempt our ſelves;</hi> and as we would <hi>be forgiven of God,</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>forgive our brethren.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Laſtly, we muſt ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to the reaſon which our Saviour uſeth in the concluſion of the prayer. As the Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>How ſhall the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned ſay Amen to thy thankſgiving?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. For there are many that will ſay with the Leapers, <hi>Ieſus Maſter, have mercie upon us:</hi> but being cleanſed, few, or none will returne to give God thankes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſay as our Saviour teacheth: <hi>Thine is Kingdome, Power and Glory, Luk.</hi> 17. We muſt not onely pray to him when wee lie ſicke upon our beds, that it would pleaſe him to comfort us, <hi>and to make our bed in our ſickneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 41.3. but to ſing praiſes to him when he ſaveth us from adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>and delivers us out of our enemies hands, Pſal.</hi> 106.129. Our <hi>Hallelu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah</hi> muſt be ſounded as loud as <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> The Saints in Heaven have no other prayer but <hi>Thankſgiving;</hi> they cry <hi>Amen, Bleſsing, and Glory, and Wiſedome, and Honour, and Power, be to God, Revel.</hi> 7.12. All their ſong is <hi>Amen, Hallelujah, Revel.</hi> 19.4.</p>
                           <p>Therefore if we will come where they are, wee muſt ſound out the praiſes of God, as they doe; If we will be like the heavenly Angels, we muſt ſpeake with the tongue of Angels; If we ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to his praiſe and honour, he will ratifie his word towards us; ſo that his promiſe to us, ſhall be <hi>Yea,</hi> and <hi>Amen.</hi>

By the firſt, he made himſelfe in caſe, and able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the worke of our Redemption: By the ſecond, he entred bound for the performing of it. All was to this end, that he might reſtore the worke of God to his originall perfection. In the bringing of which to paſſe, it was decreed by God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning (as a thing neceſſary) that the head of the Serpent (by whoſe meanes it was violated and defaced) ſhould be bruiſed.

                           <p>Our Saviour makes this queſtion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.7. upon their going out to ſee <hi>John Baptiſt; What went yee out to ſee?</hi> As if hee ſhould have ſaid, They would never have gone out into the Wilderneſſe, except it had beene to ſee ſome great and worthy matter: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold a greater and a worthier matter here.

In the tongue wherein Chriſt ſpake theſe words, namely, the Syriacke, the fitteſt word that he could finde to ſignifie the devils name, is a word that ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>Divulgator:</hi> ſo that a publiſher of infamous reports, is good Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riacke for the devill; as when a man lightly conceives a reptoach, either forging it himſelfe by miſconſtruction, or credulouſly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it upon the report of others, and then is not ſorry for his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ill, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. but rather inſulteth; not conſidering, that he himſelfe may fall into the like temptations, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.1. and ſo becomes puffed up, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. and at laſt, fals a blazing his brothers imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. Theſe come right to the devils quality, they take upon them the abetting of the devils quarrell.</p>
                           <p>It is the devils occupation to defame us firſt with God, as he did <hi>Job,</hi> as if he had beene an hypocrite, and had ſerved God onely for gaine, <hi>Job</hi> 1.9. and ſo ſtands he continually accuſing us, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 12.10. and he alſo defameth God with us, as if he were a God that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48000:364"/>did envy our good, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.1. and ſo he here defameth God to Chriſt, as if he were careleſſe in providing for him, in ſuffering him to be hungry. And from theſe two defamations proceeds all evill what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, aſwell that which the Divines call <hi>Malum poenae,</hi> as <hi>Job.</hi> 1.12. accuſing <hi>Job,</hi> that he would curſe God if he handled him rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſo got power over his goods: as that which they call <hi>Malum culpae.</hi> For his defaming God with us, was the cauſe of all ſinne: and every where ſtill we ſee he laboureth to perſwade us, that God is an unkinde God; that ſo we may burſt forth into thoſe termes, <hi>This good did I get at Gods hand,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.33. to wit, <hi>hunger.</hi> To this doth he tempt Chriſt, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. And as to deſperation, ſo ſometimes to the contrary, preſumption; as <hi>verſe</hi> 6. <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe, &amp;c.</hi> by bringing us to have a baſe conceit of God, defaming him as if he were a God of cloutes, not to be reckoned of, as if he were a man to waite upon us, and to take us up as oft as we liſt to throw our ſelves downe, that we may ſay in our hearts, as they that were frozen in their dregs did, <hi>Sophon.</hi> 1.2. <hi>He neither doth good nor hurt, it is all one to ſerve him, and not to ſerve him.</hi> He tels us (as <hi>ver.</hi> 9.) that he will give us all this, if we will fall downe and worſhip him, as though he were very liberall in rewards, and as though God were unkinde or ungratefull, not once regarding us for all our ſervice, but ſuffers us even to ſtarve. which brought men to that paſſe, as to ſay, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.14. that <hi>It is but in vaine to ſerve God, what gaine is in his ſervice?</hi> If he cannot prevaile this way againſt us, then he will try another way: for, when (ſeeing that this temptation ſucceeded not) the devill left Chriſt, he departed not for altogether, but went to come againe (as appeateth in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.13. <hi>He departed for a time.</hi>) Chriſt was too cunning for him in diſputing: he meant therefore to take another courſe; for as <hi>James</hi> noteth, <hi>chap.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. there be two ſorts of temptations, one by inticement, as a Serpent: another by violence, as a Lyon: if he cannot prevaile as a Serpent, he will play the Lyon. He had alſo another houre at Chriſt in the garden, the houre of darkeneſſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.53. there he bruiſed his heele.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Thirdly, we are to conſider the leader, <hi>He was led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> In which we are to note five things: not making any queſtion, but that it was the good Spirit, for ſo it appeareth in <hi>Luke</hi> 4.1.</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>Firſt, that the ſtate of a man regenerate by Baptiſme, is not a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtill, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.6. <hi>He found others ſtanding idle in the market place, and he ſaid to them, Why ſtand ye idle all day?</hi> We muſt not only have a mortifying and reviving, but a quickning and ſtirring ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. which will move us, and cauſe us to proceed: we muſt not lye ſtill like lumpes of fleſh, laying all upon Chriſts ſhoulders, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.16. We muſt walke forwards, for the Kingdome of God conſiſts not in words, but in power, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.19.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, as there muſt be a ſtirring, ſo this ſtirring muſt not be ſuch, as when a man is left to his owne voluntary or naturall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: wee muſt goe according as we are led. For having given our ſelves to God, we are no longer to be at our owne diſpoſition or direction: whereas before our calling, we were <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and were
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48000:364"/>carryed into errors, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2. we wandred up and downe as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterleſſe or careleſſe, or elſe gave heed to the doctrine of devils, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4. or elſe led with divers luſts, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.6. But now being become the children of God, we muſt be led by the Spirit of God: <hi>For ſo many as be the Sons of God, are led thereby, Rom.</hi> 8.14. We muſt not be l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>d by the Spirit whence the Revelation came, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. from whence revelations of fleſh and blood doe ariſe: but by the Spirit from whence the voyce came, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi> It came not by the ſpirit that miniſtred wife counſell, but by that which came downe upon them.</item>
                              <item>Thirdly, the manner of leading, is deſcribed to be ſuch a kinde of leading, as when a Ship is looſed from the ſhore, as <hi>Luke</hi> 8.22. it is called launching forth: ſo in the 18. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the 31. <hi>verſe, Paul</hi> is ſaid to have ſailed forth. The Holy Ghoſt driving us, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to a gale of winde, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.8. which teacheth us, that as when the winde bloweth, we muſt be ready to hoyſt up ſaile: ſo muſt we make us ready to be led by the Spirit. Our hope is compared to an Anchor, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.19. which muſt be haled up to us; and our Faith to the Saile, we are to beare as great a ſaile as we can. We muſt alſo looke to the cloſeneſſe of the veſſell, which is our Conſcience: for, if we have not a good conſcience, we may make ſhipwracke of Faith, Religion, and all, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.19. And thus are we to proceed in our journey towards our Country (the ſpirituall <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) as it were ſea-fating men. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.22. <hi>Now behold, I goe bound in ſpirit to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem;</hi> to which journey the love of Chriſt muſt conſtraine us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14.</item>
                              <item>Fourthly, that he was led to be tempted. His temptation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore came not by chance; nor as <hi>Job</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>chap.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 6. out of <hi>the duſt,</hi> or out of <hi>the earth,</hi> nor from <hi>the devill,</hi> not onely over <hi>Jobs</hi> perſon, but not ſo much as over his goods, <hi>Job</hi> 1.12.14. He had no power of himſelfe, no not ſo much as over the Hogges of the <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſhites,</hi> who were prophane men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.31. Hence gather wee this comfort, that the Holy Ghoſt is not a ſtander by (as a ſtranger) when we are tempted, <hi>Tanquam otioſus ſpectator;</hi> but he leads us by the hand, and ſtands by as a faithfull aſſiſtant, <hi>Eſay</hi> 4.13. He makes an iſſue out of all our temptations, and <hi>will not ſuffer us to be tempted beyond our ſtrength,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. And, he turneth the worke of ſin, and of the devill too, unto our good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. ſo that all theſe ſhall make us more wary after to reſiſt them: and hell (by fearing it) ſhall be an occaſion unto us, to avoid that might bring us to it; and ſo they ſhall all be fellow-helpers to our ſalvation. So that temptations, whether they be (as the Fathers call them) rods to chaſten us for ſinne committed, or to try and fiſt us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.12. and ſo to take away the chaffe, the fanne being in the Holy Ghoſts hand: or whether they be ſent to buffet us againſt the pricke of the fleſh, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.17. Or whether they be as matters ſerving for our experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, not onely for our ſelves, that we may know our owne ſtrength, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. and to worke patience in us: but to the devill alſo, that ſo his mouth may be ſtopped, as in <hi>Job</hi> 2.3. <hi>Haſt thou marked my ſervant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48000:365"/>Job, how upright he is, and that in all the world there is not ſuch an one?</hi> Howſoever they bee, the devill hath not the rod or chaine in his hands, but the Holy Ghoſt, to order them, as they may beſt ſerve for his glory and our good: and as for the devill, he bindeth him faſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.2.</item>
                              <item>Fifthly, by the Greeke word here uſed, is ſet forth the difference betweene the temptations of the Saints, and Reprobates. In the Lords Prayer one Petition is, <hi>Lead us not into temptation:</hi> but there, the word importeth another manner of leading, than is here meant. We doe not there pray againſt this manner of leading here, which is ſo to lead us, as to be with us, and to bring us backe againe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20. but we pray there, that he would not caſt or drive us into tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations; and when we are there, leave us, by withdrawing his grace and holy Spirit, as he doth from the reprobate and forſaken.</item>
                           </list>
                           <p n="4">IV. The fourth point is the end, that is, the Conflict, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth Chriſt; inſomuch, that he was <hi>led</hi> to be tempted. In which temptation, <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Habemus &amp; quod credenies veneremur, &amp; quod videntes imitemur:</hi> There be two things for faith to adore, and two things for imitation to practiſe.</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>Firſt, for faith, that the temptations of Chriſt have ſanctified temptations unto us: that whereas before they were curſes, like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hanging on a tree; now, ſince Chriſt hath beene both tempted and hanged on a tree, they be no longer ſignes and pledges of Gods wrath, but favours. A man may be the childe of God notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and therefore he is not to receive any diſcouragement by any of them.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, beſides the ſanctifying, it is an abatement, ſo that now when we are tempted, they have not the force they had before: for now the Serpents head is bruiſed, ſo that he is now nothing ſo ſtrong (as he was) to caſt his darts. Alſo the head of his darts are blunted, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55. <hi>Death, where is thy ſting? Hell, where is thy victory?</hi> For as his death and reſurrection had a mortifying force againſt the <hi>old man,</hi> and a quickning force toward the <hi>new man:</hi> 
                                 <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo hath his temptation a dulling force to the devill, and a ſtrengthning force to us.</item>
                           </list>
                           <p>For our life and imitation, there are alſo two.</p>
                           <p>Firſt, <hi>Compaſsion:</hi> for Chriſt knowing in what ſort we were tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, as having felt by experience, both how ſtrong the aſſaylant was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.13. who thruſt ſore at him that he might fall; and how feeble our nature is to make reſiſtance, being nothing but duſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.14. He is moved thereby to lay away ſeverity, and to put on the bowels of compaſſion. So that, <hi>Now we have not a high Prieſt which cannot bee tempted with our infirmities, but was tempted in like ſort, Heb.</hi> 4.15. So we, (which were before ſtony Judges, and too rough for Phyſitians) ought in like ſort, (having beene tempted our ſelves) to looke upon others defects with a more paſſionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond thing we are to imitate, Chriſt is our <hi>fellow-helper,</hi> in all our neceſſities and temptations; who, as he ſheweth us his ſleights
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48000:365"/>and darts, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. ſo he teacheth us how to avoyd them. This is no ſmall comfort to us, when we conſider that <hi>he is with us,</hi> and will be, <hi>till the end of the world, Matth.</hi> 28.20. who hath <hi>overcome the world, Joh.</hi> 16.33. and <hi>the devill:</hi> if any temptation happen, that he will beare us out, we may be of good cheere. This was it that did ſo animate <hi>Job, Doe thou but take my part, and who ſhall touch me? Job</hi> 17.3. When as both Chriſt and we draw together in one yoke, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.29. what can hurt us? Yet if we be afraid for that we ſee the enemy comming; let us call for the helpe of our aſſiſtant, and as it is ſaid in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.1. we ſhall ſee <hi>God will ariſe, and his enemies ſhall bee ſcattered: they ſhall vaniſh like ſmoke, and melt like waxe.</hi> When they are ready to attache us, let us ſay, <hi>Save me O God, for the waters are entred even into my ſoule, Pſal.</hi> 69.1. When we are feeble, then let us ſay with <hi>Ezekiel, O Lord it hath oppreſſed me, comfort me, Ezek.</hi> 38.14. Or though they have wounded us, let us ſay with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, Bring out thy ſpeare, and ſtop the way againſt them that perſecute me, Pſal.</hi> 35.3. <hi>Say yet to my Soule, I am thy Salvation.</hi> So that we have not onely an <hi>example,</hi> but a <hi>comfort</hi> too.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. The fifth point, is the day and time when this was done, in which we are to note two things. The word <hi>[Then]</hi> relateth as well to the end of the Chapter next going before, as to the preſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
                           <list>
                              <item>Firſt then, when as Chriſt was but newly come out of the water of Baptiſme, and immediately after the heavens had opened unto him, and the Holy Ghoſt deſcended upon him in the likeneſſe of a Dove, and while he was yet full of the Holy Ghoſt; did the devill ſet upon him. When as the voyce from Heaven had pronounced, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne, in whom I am well pleaſed;</hi> the devill ſtraight addeth; in whom I am ill pleaſed: and ſo addreſſeth himſelfe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him. And it is Gods property to looke for much at his hands, to whom he hath given much. When he gives a man a large mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of grace, he gives the devill withall a large patent. Our Saviour had great gifts, and the devill is like a theefe, that will venter moſt for the greateſt booty.</item>
                              <item>Secondly, in regard of the preſent, we are to note, that in thirty yeares, the devill did nothing to our Saviour: but now when hee goes about to gird himſelfe with our ſalvation, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.3. then doth the devill gird on his ſword alſo; that is as much to ſay, as the better the worke is, the more reſiſtance it ſhall have. Ten repulſes did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſuffer, before they could get poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the promiſed Land of <hi>Canaan:</hi> and as many did <hi>David</hi> endure before he was inveſted in the promiſed Kingdome. Many lets came before the Temple was re-edifyed, as is to be ſeene in <hi>Eſdras</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> Yea, (ſaith the devill) Hath God <hi>annoynted him with the oyle of gladneſſe above his fellowes?</hi> I will ſee if I can annoynt him with the oyle of ſadneſſe above his fellowes. Hath he beene <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of water and the Holy Ghoſt?</hi> I will provide another Baptiſme for him, namely, of fire. Hath God <hi>ſent downe the Holy Ghoſt upon him in likeneſſe of a Dove?</hi> I will cauſe tribulation, and a crowne of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48000:366"/>thornes to light upon his head. Hath a voyce come downe from Heaven, ſaying, <hi>This is my beloved Sonne?</hi> I will provide a voyce for him, that ſhall aſcend from the foote, that ſhall ſay, <hi>If thou be the Son of God, come downe from the Croſſe.</hi>
                              </item>
                           </list>

So, in the Transfigura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Mount, he was found alone, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.36. So in the garden in his great agony, he was in effect alone; for his Diſciples ſlept all the while, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.40. that unto him might be aſcribed all the praiſe.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, wee will note heare, that there is no place priviledged from temptations. As there be ſome that thinke there be certaine places to be exempt from Gods preſence, (as was noted in the dreame of <hi>Jacob:</hi>) ſo the Monkes and Hermites thought, that by avoyding company, they ſhould be free from temptations; which is not ſo. For, although Chriſt were alone in the Wilderneſſe, and faſting too, yet was he tempted we ſee. And yet it is true, that hee that will live well, muſt ſhunne the company of the wicked, <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.7.</p>
                           <p>When the Angels had brought <hi>Lot</hi> and his family out of the doores, they charged them not to tarry, nor to ſtand ſtill, nor once to looke backe. So after the Cocke had crowed, and put <hi>Peter</hi> in minde of his fall; he <hi>went out of the doores and wept bitterly, Matth.</hi> 26.75. his ſolitarineſſe was a cauſe to make his repentance the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and helped to increaſe his teares: and company is commonly an hinderance to the receiving of any good grace, and to the exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and confirming us in any good purpoſe. But as true it is, that temptations are, and may as well be in the deſerts, as in publique places: not onely in the valleyes, but in the mountaines, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and not onely in the countrey, but even in the holy City, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. yea, and ſometimes full, and ſometimes faſting, yea, in Paradiſe and in Heaven it ſelfe; for thither doth the devill come and accuſe us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God: we are therefore alwayes to ſtand upon our guard. For in <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.24. he is ſaid, to <hi>walke through dry places,</hi> leſt happily ſome might be eſcaped from him thither: and though we could goe whither he could not come, we ſhould not be free: for we carry ever a <hi>Tempter</hi> about with us. And when we pray to be delivered from temptation, it is not onely from the devill, but from our ſelves: we carry fire within us. <hi>Nazianzen</hi> and <hi>Baſil</hi> were of that minde once, that by change of the place a man might goe from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: but afterward they recanted it, affirming, That it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to avoyd temptation, yea, though he went out of the world, except he left his heart behinde him alſo.</p>

So <hi>Elias,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18. at the reſtoring of the ſame Law, did the like. And ſo when they went about the re-edifying of the Temple, as appeareth <hi>Eſdras</hi> 8.49. So in the New Teſtament, at the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Act.</hi> 13.3. And (as <hi>Jerome</hi> reporteth) Saint <hi>John</hi> would not undertake to write the divine worke of his Goſpell, untill the whole Church (by Faſting) had recommended the ſame unto God.</p>
                           <p>So likewiſe, at the entrance into a Conflict, for the obtaining of ſome Victory, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> did when he overcame the <hi>Amorites,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. So did <hi>Heſter</hi> when ſhe went about the deliverance of the Jewes, as in <hi>Eſter</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. And <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth, that
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48000:367"/>when <hi>Peter</hi> was to enter diſputation with <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> there was Faſting throughout the whole Church generally. Whether at the entrance into a Calling, or to reſiſt the devill, Saint <hi>Peters</hi> rule, mentioned in his firſt chapter and fifth verſe, ought to take place, we muſt uſe <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Faſting.</hi> And as at all times wee are to uſe watchfullneſſe and carefulneſſe: ſo then eſpecially, when we looke that the devill will be moſt buſie; and the rather, for that in ſome caſes there is no dealing without Faſting, as <hi>Marke</hi> 9.29. there is a kinde of devill that will not be caſt out, without <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>As for the number of dayes wherein he faſted, juſt forty; Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity may finde it ſelfe worke enough; but it is dangerous to make Concluſions, when no certainety appeareth. Some ſay, there is a correſpondency betweene theſe forty dayes, and the forty dayes wherein the world was deſtroyed by the Deluge. But it is better to ſay, As <hi>Moſes</hi> faſted forty dayes at the inſtitution of the Law, and <hi>Elias</hi> forty at the reſtauration; ſo Chriſt here. And becauſe hee came but in the ſhape of a ſervant, hee would not take upon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his fellow-ſervants. Contrary to our times, wherein a man is accounted no body, except he can have a quirke above his fellows. But it is more materiall, to ſee how it concerneth us. It is a thing rather to be adored by admiration, then to be followed by apiſh imitation.</p>
                           <p>This Faſt here, was not the faſt of a day, as that of <hi>Peter</hi> and of <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10.9.30. but ſuch as <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2. deſcribeth, <hi>Hee did eate nothing all that time.</hi> Saint <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> though his life were very ſtrict, did eate Locuſts and wilde Honey, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.4. Ours is not properly a Faſt, but a provocation of meates; and therefore there can be no proportion betweene them. But as it is, what is to be thought of it? <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Irenaeus</hi> record, that at the firſt, the Church did uſe to celebrate but one day in remembrance of Chriſts Faſt, till after, the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> (a certaine ſect of heretiques, who thereupon are called <hi>Eucratitae</hi>) raiſed it to foureteene dayes; the zeale of the Clergy after increaſed it to forty, after to fifty: The Monkes brought it to ſixty, the Fryers to ſeventy; and if the Pope had not there ſtayed it, they would have brought it to eighty, and ſo have doubled Chriſts faſting. When the Primitive Church ſaw the Heretiques (by this outward ſhew) goe about to diſgrace the Chriſtians, by this counterfeit ſhew of holineſſe; they uſed it alſo: but (ſaith <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi>) they held it onely a poſitive law, which was in the Church to uſe or take away, and not as any exerciſe of godlineſſe.</p>
                           <p>Onely a doubt reſteth now, becauſe of the hardneſſe of mens hearts, whether it were better left or kept. Some would have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence uſed, and one day kept for the Sabbath, but left to every mans liberty, what time and day, and tyed to no certainety: but that were (upon the matter) to have none kept at all. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the Reformed Church (as that of <hi>France</hi>) have uſed their liberty in removing of it, for that they ſaw an inclination in their
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48000:367"/>people to ſuperſtition, who would thinke themſelves holyer for ſuch faſting; like the Phariſees, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. The Church wherein we live, uſeth her liberty in retayning it, and that upon good reaſons: for ſith God hath created the fiſhes of the ſea for man, and giveth him an intereſt in them alſo, <hi>Gen.</hi> 9.2. as well as in the beaſts: Sith the death of fiſh was a plague wherewith God plagued <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and ſo contrariwiſe the encreaſe of fiſh is a bleſſing: God will have fiſh to be uſed, ſo that he may have praiſes as well for the ſea, as for the land, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.25.</p>
                           <p>If we looke into the civill reaſon, we ſhall ſee great cauſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it. See <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.22. the abundance of fleſh that was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in one moneth. The mainetenance of ſtore then is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and therefore order muſt be taken accordingly. <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> had fiſh dayes, that <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and ſuch like, living upon Navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might have utterance for their commodities, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 13.16. (for <hi>Tyrus</hi> was the maritine City, till after <hi>Alexander</hi> annexed to it ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther City, and made it dry.)</p>
                           <p>The Tribe of <hi>Zabulon</hi> lived by Navigation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.13. which is a thing neceſſary both for wealth, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 9.20. and made <hi>Solomon</hi> richer than any other King, and alſo for munition, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 23.4. that Tribe therefore had need of maintenance. And therefore our Church and Common-wealth have taken order accordingly; and the rather, for that our times require it: (for the times that forbad marriage and the abſtinence of meates, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3.) There is more feare of a pottingerfull of gluttony, than a ſpoonefull of ſuperſtition. This is no Faſt, but a change of meate.</p>
                           <div n="3" type="verse">

                                 <hi>Verſe 3.</hi> Then came to him the Tempter, &amp;c.</head>
                              <p>BEfore we come to the particular temptations, we have foure ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall points to be conſidered. Firſt, the changing of the devils name, from <hi>devill</hi> to <hi>Tempter:</hi> Secondly, that it is ſaid, <hi>Hee came unto him:</hi> Thirdly, that he came when he was faſting: Fourthly, the diverſity and order of the temptations.</p>
                              <p n="1">I. Firſt, in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.13. it is ſaid, that <hi>God tempteth no man;</hi> and yet in <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. it appeareth, that <hi>God doth tempt ſome;</hi> we muſt then make a difference betweene Gods temptations, and the devils. The devill indeed tempteth us, but God (as our Engliſh tranſlation hath it) tryeth us. The latter is to commend us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.5. or rather that our tribulation may bring forth patience, and patience hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.3. It makes us know that to be in our ſelves, which before wee knew not, as we ſee in <hi>Job.</hi> So the Lord proved the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to ſee if they loved him or no, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. The devils temptation is to know our corruption: for knowing the innocency of <hi>Adam,</hi> hee went about to corrupt him. It is like the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> proving of Manna, to try concluſions. Gods is like the tryall of gold, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.7. which the oftner it is tryed, the purer it waxeth: the devils, like that of Manna, which ſtinketh and corrupteth by tryall. Gods is like the tryall of the fanne, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.12. the devils like that of the ſcive,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48000:368"/>
                                 <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. which lets goe the flower, and keepes the branne.</p>
                              <p n="2">II. Secondly, the devill hath two ſhapes; in the one, he tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and allureth, (and in that he came now to our Saviour:) in the other, he aſſayleth us, that is, by aſſault and violence, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.11. The firſt is the temptation of hypocrites, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.18. <hi>Shall we pay tribute to Caeſar?</hi> The ſecond, of <hi>Judas,</hi> who in the garden aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 6.70. So Satan ſets on Chriſt by violence. He came unto Chriſt by caſting ſparkes of fire into him; for hee was devoyd of any wicked and vaine thoughts comming forth of him.</p>
                              <p>Two wayes may a man be tempted: either by doubts ariſing in our hearts out of us, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.38. or by a ſop entring into us, <hi>John</hi> 13.27. Chriſt could not be tempted the firſt way: for he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd of any wicked and vaine thought, comming forth of him. To us the devill needs bring but a paire of bellowes, for he ſhall finde fire within us: but to Chriſt he was faine to bring fire too.</p>
                              <p n="3">III. Thirdly, he then came to him when he was faſting, which diſcovereth the devils deſperate boldneſſe, as alſo his craftineſſe, in that he waited his time, to ſtay till he was hungry. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt was newly come from his Baptiſme, and was full of the Holy Ghoſt, and even now in his exerciſe of mortification; yet had the devill courage to ſet upon him. There is no place ſo holy, nor exerciſe ſo good, as can repreſſe his courage, or give a ſtay to the boldneſſe of his attempts: as we ſee, <hi>Marke</hi> 4.14. The word is no ſooner ſowne, but Satan comes immediately, and takes it out of their hearts: which muſt needes be done in the Church. For the word is out, before they be out of the Church: ſo that hee is not affraid of hearing the word, but can abide it well enough, yea, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than many. And though they carry the word out of the Church, he will waite on them home, and choake the word with cares, and riches, and voluptuous living, like the ſeed that fell among thornes, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.14.</p>
                              <p>And no more doth he care for the exerciſe of prayer: for even then immediately after the repetition of forgiveneſſe, when we have made even with all the world, when God hath forgiven us, and we others; then doth the devill give us occaſion to ſay, <hi>Lead us not into temptation,</hi> as ſtanding by there ready to tempt us.</p>
                              <p>And as little cares he for the Sacraments: for preſently after they had received the Sacrament, and ſang the hymne, Chriſt tels them, they <hi>ſhall all be offended in him that night, Matth.</hi> 26.1. Thus we ſee his courage ſerves him at all times, nothing is able to quaile it.</p>
                              <p>As this ought not to diſcourage the children of God, having ſo faithfull an aſſiſtant to take their part: ſo it giveth them this caveat, that they be at no time ſecure, but alwayes to keepe a ſure guard. Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> in the middeſt of a Sermon was ſolicited to vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory, becauſe he thought he pleaſed his auditors, and thereupon brake off his ſpeech, and turned it to the devill, ſaying; <hi>Non propter te hoc opus coeptum eſt; nec propter te, nec in te finitur.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>And as he is couragious, ſo he is ſubtle: for notwithſtanding his
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48000:368"/>eager deſire, he ſtaid the fitteſt time, wherein conſiſteth a chiefe point of wiſedome. So when he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> he ſtaid till her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was away, and till he could ſhew her the fruite which was ſo pleaſing to the eye. So when <hi>David</hi> lay with <hi>Bathſheba, Vriahs</hi> wife, he tempted him in the evening, and after his ſleepe, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.12. a very fit time for the purpoſe. So when they were aſleepe, the enemy ſowed tares, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.</p>
                              <p>And as he is wary in chooſing his time, ſo is he as cunning in chuſing the meanes, obſerving the diſpoſitions of men. For wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and voluptuous men, he hath the daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> a bayte fit for their humors, whereby to tempt them to idolatry, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.1. For men ſecure and careleſſe, he hath a net that ſufficeth to throw over them, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26.) and ſnare them in. For others, that have more care to ſeeke and inquire into things, hee hath quils to blow them up, as <hi>knowledge which puffes up,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. Yea, even the beſt things can he make ſerve for his purpoſe, and to be occaſions of temptations; ſo that he may finde better entertainement, for the good exerciſes ſake that come with him. He will come ſometimes ſhrowded in the neceſſity of nature, as here; for when a man is hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, nature requireth ſomewhat to aſſwage it.</p>
                              <p>Prayer, no man doubteth to be a godly exerciſe; yet thereby he tempted them that loved to pray in the Synagogues, and make much babling, and repetition, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.5.7. In like ſort doth he abuſe the name of good counſell, as in <hi>Peter</hi> to Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.22. who (as a friend) wiſhed him to ſpare himſelfe, and live out his time.</p>
                              <p>Thus can he put on a faire ſhew, the ſooner to beguile: and for good reaſon, for if he ſhould come unmasked in his owne likeneſſe, he would be rejected; as if <hi>Jehoram</hi> the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had come himſelfe without <hi>Jehoſhaphat, Eliſha</hi> would not have looked on him: ſo by a good pretence, the temptation ſhroudes and inſinuates it ſelfe; otherwiſe, it would not be looked on.</p>
                              <p n="4">IV. Now we are to conſider the diverſity and order of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations, and then will we handle them particularly. And firſt we are to note, that though there are but theſe three recorded, yet he endured divers others. His whole life was full of temptations, as may appeare by <hi>Luke</hi> 22.28. It is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.2. that he was tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forty dayes of the devill, whereas theſe three temptations here ſet downe, were not till after the end of forty dayes. Theſe onely are mentioned, but there were other not written, as divers of his miracles are unwritten, <hi>John</hi> 20.25. Onely, <hi>ſo much was written as was expedient.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Theſe three are a briefe Abridgement of all his temptations. As it is true that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt reſembled Adam, and was made a quickning ſpirit, as Adam was a living ſoule,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. And the bringing of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> out of Egypt, by being called our of Egypt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.15. So may Chriſt and <hi>Adam</hi> bee compared in theſe three temptations. For they both were tempted with concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence of the fleſh, concupiſcence of the eye, and pride of life, 1
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48000:369"/>
                                 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. In <hi>Adam</hi> the devill firſt brought him into a conceite, that God envyed his good. As we ſee Faulconers put hoods over Hawks eyes, to make them more quiet and ruly. Secondly, he lulles him on to a proud conceit of himſelfe, by perſwading him that by <hi>eating</hi> he ſhould <hi>be like God.</hi> Thirdly, he ſheweth the fruit, which was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant. So in Chriſts temptation: Firſt, he would have brought him to murmure againſt God: Secondly, to preſume: and thirdly, to commit Idolatry; all which are ſet downe in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 6, 7. <hi>verſes.</hi> And under theſe three heads come all temptations, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. &amp; 21. &amp; <hi>Exodus</hi> 32.</p>
                              <p>To ſome of theſe extreames will the devill ſeeke to drive one. Firſt, by diſtruſt he will ſeeke to drive us to uſe unlawfull meanes, for the obtaining of neceſſary things, as bread is when a man is hungry. Or if we be in no ſuch want, that that temptation cannot take place, then (through ſuperfluity) hee will tempt us to wanton and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary deſires, as to throw our ſelves downe, that the Angels may take us up: and having prevailed ſo farre, then hee carryeth us to the devill and all. <hi>All this will I give thee;</hi> there is his <hi>[All:] Fall downe and worſhip me,</hi> there is the devill with it: ſo that (in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect) it may well be ſaid, that <hi>The way of a Serpent is over a ſtone, Prov.</hi> 30.19. He goeth ſo ſlily, that a man ſeeth him in, before hee can tell what way, or how he got in. Firſt, he wraps himſelfe in neceſſity, and thereby windes himſelfe in unperceived, then he brings us to make riches our God.</p>
                              <p>Now let us ſee his darts. The firſt is, of making ſtones bread: This may well be called, <hi>The hungry Temptation.</hi> The ſtreame of the Doctors, make <hi>Adams</hi> offence the ſinne of Gluttony: but <hi>Bucer</hi> thinkes, that this temptation is rather to be referred to diſtruſt and deſpaire. There is ſmall likelihood, that one ſhould ſinne in glutto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by eating bread onely. The devils deſire was onely, that the ſtones might be turned into bread, and that after ſo long a Faſt: and then, if the temptation had beene to Gluttony, Chriſts anſwer had been nothing to the purpoſe, the Devill might well have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed againſt the inſufficiency of it. For gluttony is to be anſwered by a Text willing ſobriety: whereas this Text which Chriſt anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by, containeth rather an aſſertion of Gods providence: and therefore our Saviour ſhould have ſeemed very unskilfull in defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe. The temptation therefore is to diſtruſt.</p>
                              <p>This ſtandeth well with the devils cunning in fight: for by this be ſhooteth firſt even at the throate, and at that which is the life of a Chriſtian, to wit, his faith; as a man would ſay, <hi>Iugulum petit,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at that which overcommeth the world, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.5. He tempted him to ſuch a diſtruſt, as was in the <hi>Iſraelites, Exod.</hi> 17.7. when they asked if God were with them, or no? So he made <hi>Adam</hi> thinke, God cared not for him: ſo here the devill premiſeth a doubt to ſhake his faith, wherein Chriſt made no doubt, <hi>Si filius Dei es.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Indeed you heard a voyce ſay, you were the <hi>beloved Sonne of God,</hi> but are you ſo indeed? or was it not rather a deluſion? You ſee yon are almoſt ſtarved for want of bread: well, would God have ſuffered
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48000:369"/>you ſo to be, if you had been his <hi>Filius dilectus?</hi> No, you are ſome hunger-ſtarved child, So <hi>Luke</hi> 22.31. Chriſt prayed, that <hi>Peters faith might not faile.</hi> It was that the devill ſhot at. He is a <hi>roaring Lyon, ſeeking to devoure us,</hi> whom we muſt reſiſt by faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. It is our Faith that he aymes at, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.5. For having overthrowne that, diſobedience ſoone will follow. Having aboliſhed the ſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. the <hi>breach of the Law</hi> muſt needs follow. He hath then fit time to ſet us aworke, about making ſtones into bread, that is, to get our living by unlawfull meanes. Firſt, ſhipwracke of faith, then of obedience.</p>
                              <p>The devill here ſeeing him in great want and hunger, would thereby bring in doubt, that he was not the Sonne of God; which is not a good argument. For whether we reſpect the naturall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of Gods favour, we ſee they happen not to the wiſeſt and men of beſt and greateſt knowledge, as appeareth in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 9.11. or the ſupernaturall favour of God. We ſhall ſee <hi>Abraham</hi> forced to flye his Country into <hi>Egypt</hi> for famine, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10.12. So did <hi>Iſaac, Gen.</hi> 26.1. And <hi>Jacob</hi> likewiſe was in the ſame diſtreſſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.1. Notwithſtanding that God was called, <hi>The God of Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob;</hi> yet were they all three like to be hunger-ſtarved. Yea, not onely ſo, but for their faith many were burned and ſtoned, <hi>of whom the world was not worthy, Heb.</hi> 11.37. So fared it with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, they were hungry, naked, and a thirſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. But what doe we ſpeake of the adopted Sonnes of God, when as his owne naturall Sonne ſuffered as much, nay, farre more? Here we ſee he was hungry, alſo he was wearied with travaile, and faine to reſt, <hi>John</hi> 4.6. he had no houſe to hide his head in, whereas <hi>Foxes have holes.</hi>
                              </p>

                              <p>THe Heathens have obſerved, that in Rhetoricke it is a point of chiefeſt cunning, when you would out-face a man, or importune him to doe a thing, to preſſe and urge him with that, which he will not or cannot for ſhame deny to be in himſelfe, As by ſaying, if you have any wit, then you will doe thus and thus: if you be an honeſt man or a good fellow, doe this. So here the devill (not being to learne any point of ſubtilty) comes to our Saviour, ſaying, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> (as it may be doubted, you being in this caſe) then, <hi>make theſe ſtones bread.</hi> No, no, it followes not: a man may be the Sonne of God, and not ſhew it by any ſuch Art. So when <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi> asked, who accuſed Chriſt? they anſwered, <hi>If he had not beene a malefactor, we would not have brought him before thee, John</hi> 18.30. They were jolly grave men, it was a flat flattery: and in <hi>John</hi> 21.23. there is the like. This ought to put us in minde, when wee are tempted in like manner, that we take heed we be not out-faced.</p>
                              <p>In the matter it ſelfe, we are to conſider theſe points: Firſt, the devill ſets it downe for a ground, that (follow what will) bread muſt needs be had. Therefore Chriſt firſt cloſeth with him. Admit he had bread, were he then ſafe? No, <hi>We live not by bread onely:</hi> ſo that bread is not of abſolute neceſſity. Well, what followes of that?
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:48000:370"/>Bread you muſt needs have, you ſee your want, God hath left off to provide for you. Then comes the concluſion, Therefore ſhift for your ſelfe as well as you can. Firſt, he ſoliciteth us to a mutinous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining within our ſelves, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8. <hi>Harden not your hearts, as in the day of temptation, &amp;c.</hi> whereby he forceth us to breake out into ſuch like conceites, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116.11. <hi>I ſaid in my diſtreſſe that all men be ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars:</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.22. <hi>I ſaid in my haſte, I am caſt off.</hi> Thus cloſely he diſtruſted God, in ſaying, his Prophets propheſie lyes, till at laſt, we even open our mouthes againſt God himſelfe, and ſay, <hi>This evill commeth from the Lord: ſhall I attend on the Lord any longer?</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 6.33. Hunger and ſhame is all we ſhall get at Gods hands. And ſo caſting off God, betake themſelves to ſome other Patron, and then the devill is fitteſt for their turne. For when we are fallen out with one, it is beſt ſerving his enemy, and to retaine to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary faction. Then we ſeeke a Familiar (with <hi>Saul</hi>) to anſwer us, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.7.</p>
                              <p>But what did the devill then tell him? did he bring comfort with him? No: he tels him, that to morrow he and his ſennes ſhould dye. So here doth the devill bring a ſtone with him. <hi>What Father</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>if his Sonne aske him bread, would give him a ſtone? Matth.</hi> 7.9. yet the devill doth ſo; Chriſt was hungry, and the devill ſhewes him ſtones.</p>
                              <p>Here is the devils comfort, here be ſtones for thee, if thou canſt deviſe any way to make theſe ſtones bread, thou art well; whereas we doe not uſe to make bread of ſtones, but of wheate, to worke it with the ſweat of our browes; to get it ſo, we learne <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19.</p>
                              <p>By extortion and uſury we may make ſtones into bread, that is the devils Alchymiſtry: or haply we may make bread of nothing, when a man gets a thing by anothers overſight, <hi>Gen.</hi> 43.12. Or elſe, what and if we can over-reach our brother in ſubtilty, and goe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond him with a tricke of wit or cunning? <hi>Let no man defraud or oppreſſe his brother in any matter: for the Lord is avenged of all ſuch,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. The one is called <hi>the bread of violence and oppreſsion, Prov.</hi> 4.17. The other, <hi>The bread of deceit.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>They are indeed both made of ſtones, for they ſtill retaine their former property, as the event will declare. For though in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſuch bread be pleaſant, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17. yet after, his <hi>mouth is but filled with gravell.</hi> After which will conſequently follow, gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</p>

                           <p>It warnes us aforehand of the devils com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, ſo that we may have time to prepare our ſelves accordingly. For as at that time the devill came upon Chriſt when hunger pinched him: ſo where we are in any diſtreſſe, we are to looke for temptations.</p>
                           <p>This temptation hath two parts,
<list>
                                 <item>Firſt comes <hi>(Si,)</hi> a diſtruſt:</item>
                                 <item>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly followes unlawfull meanes.</item>
                              </list> Having laid this foundation, that bread is neceſſary to be had when one is hungry; he inferreth, that God helpeth not, nor ſupplyeth the want: therefore God is not the Father, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.6. and therefore depend no longer on him, but ſhift for your ſelfe. This is the effect of the devils argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                           <p>The Fathers upon the words, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. <hi>(Take the ſhield of faith, to quench all the fiery darts of the devill)</hi> doe note, that about every one of the darts or temptations of the devill, there are (as it were) bals of wilde fire. For being to aſſault our obedience, and knowing that faith is our ſhield: to that end he uſeth the arrow head, which is, diſtruſt in God, about which is fire; to wit, the uſing of unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, to conſume our obedience, which will conſume our ſhield of faith, and ſo make way for the dart to kill or wound us. So that his drift is, to bring our adoption or Son-ſhip, to a <hi>Si.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>There is no doubt but Chriſt was able to have turned ſtones into bread: but why would he not then follow the devils advice? The devill by ſaying, <hi>Say unto theſe ſtones,</hi> ſeemeth to acknowledge, that
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48000:371"/>he had the force to have done it, even by his bare word: for even ſtones are ſaid to heare the voyce of God, and obey his commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and not onely Gods, but even Gods ſervants, as 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 13.5. when the man of God had pronounced, that the Altar ſhould rent in ſunder, it did ſo. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.5. when Jeſus cryed out with a loud voyce, the vaile of the Temple rent in twaine, the earth did quake, and the ſtones were cloven. The dead men are worſe than ſtones, yet they in their graves heard his voyce.</p>
                           <p>And not onely was he able to turne ſtones into bread, but into men alſo: as Children to <hi>Abraham</hi> of ſtones, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.9. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it had pleaſed him, he was as well able at this time to have tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtones into bread, as after he turned water into Wine, <hi>John</hi> 2.10.</p>
                           <p>It was no leſſe poſſible to him (no doubt) to have ſaved himſelfe, when the Jewes ſcoffingly bad him, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.42. as to have ſaved others; and to have come downe from the Croſſe being alive, as it was after for him, not onely being dead and buryed, but a great ſtone being over him, to remove it, and come out of the grave, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.2. He had power to both, but not will alike to both.</p>
                           <p>But why would he not here uſe his power, for the ſatisfying of his hunger, and follow the devils advice? In ſetting downe the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of turning water into Wine, it is thus further ſaid, that he did it, <hi>That his Diſciples might beleeve in him, John</hi> 2.11. That was the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that moved him to the working of that miracle: and becauſe there was no ſuch cauſe here, he did it not. For the devill would not beleeve in him (he knew) though he had done it. The devill deſired him, but to have him ſhew what he could doe for a need onely, for a vaunt of his power: wherein we ſee the humour of pride, that made him at the firſt to fall.</p>
                           <p>It is the ſame temptation that his kinsfolkes uſed, <hi>No man doth any thing ſecretly, that ſeeketh to be famous; if thou doſt theſe things, ſhew thy ſelfe to the world.</hi> But ſee how unfitly the Temptation hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth together. He ſhould rather have ſaid, <hi>If you be hungry;</hi> then, <hi>If you be the Sonne of God:</hi> and then rather have bid him faſt forty dayes more, then turne the ſtones into bread. If it had beene to have made a Sonne of God, Chriſt would have done it: but not to have ſhewed himſelfe to be the Sonne of God.</p>
                           <p>But it may be asked, why did Chriſt vouchſafe to give him any anſwer at all; whereas he might have commanded him to ſilence, and <hi>tormented him before his time,</hi> and have puniſhed him for his ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cineſſe? When <hi>Peter</hi> tempted him, he cut him up very ſharpely, ſaying, <hi>Come behinde me Satan, Marke</hi> 8.33. Why did he not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the devill ſo? He might have enjoyned him, and throwne him into the bottomleſſe pit, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.31. or at the leaſt bidden him, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voyd Satan, verſe</hi> 10. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> anſwereth this doubt, that Chriſt anſwered in the like time, to teach us to anſwer: willing us thereby (as <hi>Abimelech</hi> did his ſouldiers) to doe as he had done before: <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.48. So Chriſt is our example, <hi>John</hi> 13.15. and bids us <hi>doe as hee hath done.</hi> Chriſt is our Captaine, he hath gone before us, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48000:371"/>ſhewed us how to behave our ſelves in fight: when the devill aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us with diſtruſt, then are we to ward it off with a Text of Gods providence: and ſo to the reſt, as he hath done before us. Our Saviours ſhield, whereby (we ſee) he beareth off all the devils darts, is covered all over with <hi>Scriptum eſt.</hi> We have here a briefe view of the Churches Armory, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.4. of the Tower of <hi>David,</hi> built for defence. Here be the ſhields wherewith <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which <hi>Paul</hi> calleth, <hi>The weapons of our warfare,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. not carnall, but mighty (through God) to caſt downe holds.</p>
                           <p>They are in number five: Firſt, a preparation of our ſelves by the uſe of Gods Sacraments, that we may be the more ſtrong to ſuſtaine and beare off temptations, and to hold out to the end without fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. Secondly, a withdrawing our ſelves into the deſert, or ſome other ſolitary place, there (by Meditation) to kindle good thoughts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. Thirdly, faſting. Fourthly, watchfull prayer, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.41. Fifthly, the perfecting our ſelves in the Scriptures. Theſe be the five ſhields wherewith <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple was hanged.</p>
                           <p>Now as for the Scripture, we are to note, that where God ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of any good that we are to receive out of it, it is commended to us as a ſtorehouſe, whither we are to make our reſort for the bread of life, and the water of life, <hi>whereof he that taſteth, ſhall never thirſt, John</hi> 6.35. And from thence are we to draw the waters of comfort, out of the fountaines of ſalvation, <hi>Eſay</hi> 12.3. When there is any ill ſpoken of, which we are to reſiſt, then it is commended to us as an Armory, whence we may fetch any kinde of weapon which we ſhall need, either offenſive, as a ſword, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. or defenſive, as a ſhield, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.5.</p>
                           <p>The Scripture is the broad plate that is to beare off the darts: our faith is the braces or handle whereby we take hold, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.16. and lift it up to defend our ſelves withall. For the Scripture is a ſhield, <hi>Non quod dicitur, ſed quod dicitur. Dicitur;</hi> there is the ſtrong and broad matter, fit to beare off: and <hi>Creditur,</hi> that is the handle or braces to it, <hi>God ſpake once or twice, I have heard it, Power belongeth unto God, Pſal.</hi> 62.11. So that it ſufficeth not that it be ſpoken one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by God, but we muſt heare it too: neither muſt we heare it as the voyce of a man (as <hi>Samuel</hi> at the firſt did; who when God cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him thought it the voyce of <hi>Eli:</hi>) but as the voyce of God, that we which were dead in our ſins, he hath quickned and forgiven us all our treſpaſſes, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. This is the perfection of our faith.</p>
                           <p>Generally of the Scriptures, this is Chriſts opinion, confirmed by his owne practiſe; that if the devill come as a Serpent, here is a charme for him, <hi>Pſalme</hi> 58.5. Or if he come as a Lyon, here is that is able to prevaile againſt him, 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5.8. And that the devill knowes well enough, as appeareth by his malice that hee hath alwayes borne it, before it was Scripture, when it was but one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Dictum.</hi> For ſo ſoone as God had ſaid, <hi>Let us make man in our likeneſſe,</hi> that word was ſtraight a whetſtone to the devils envy. And after the fall, when the ſeed was promiſed, that was, and is the cauſe of all the devils enmity, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.15. So when the promiſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48000:372"/>was reiterated, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.18. that was the cauſe he ſo turmoyled all the Patriarchs.</p>
                           <p>But when the word was to be written, and to become Scripture, then his malice began to grow very hot, inſomuch that he cauſed it for anger to be broken, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19. For the Fathers are of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that all the devils buſie endevour, in making the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to commit idolatry with the golden Calfe, was to the end, that he might ſo heate <hi>Moſes</hi> in his zeale, as that in his anger hee ſhould breake the Tables of the Law, by caſting them haſtily out of his hands. We are to note therefore; that there is a forcible ſound in the word, which the Devill cannot abide; and not onely the ſound, but the ſight alſo.</p>
                           <p>It is written of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> that lying ſicke on his bed, he cauſed the ſeven penitentiall Pſalmes to be painted on the wall over againſt him, in great Letters; that if after he ſhould become ſpeechleſſe, yet he might point to every verſe when the devill came to tempt him; and ſo confute him. <hi>Bleſſed is he that hath his quiver full of ſuch arrowes, they ſhall not be aſhamed.</hi> Bleſſed is he that hath the skill to chooſe out fit arrowes for the purpoſe, as the Fathers ſpeake out of <hi>Eſay</hi> 49.2. Chriſt ſaith affirmatively of the Scriptures, that <hi>in them is eternall life, John</hi> 5.39. Negatively, that the cauſe of error is the not knowing of them, <hi>Marke</hi> 12.24. <hi>David</hi> ſaith, it was that that made him wiſer than his enemies, than his teachers, and than the Ancients, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.98.99. &amp; 110. Knowledge of the truth, is the way to amendment after a fall, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. There is much cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling now adayes for the Word, and others finde fault as faſt, that it is no better harkned unto. For as the want of obedience, and all other abuſes (which are ſo much cryed out againſt) proceed not onely from the not hearing of the Word, but aſwell from the not mingling of faith with it, (without which mixture, it is nothing worth) it profiteth not, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. So the error of the former times was, in yeelding too farre to the devils policy, by ſealing up the Scriptures, and locking the ſtorehouſe and Armory of the people. It is the policy Chriſt tels us of in the 11. of <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. A ſtrong man puts the ſtrong armed man out of his houſe, and takes away his armour from him: then he needs not feare him.</p>
                           <p>The like policy we read of, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.19. when the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> had taken away all Smiths and Armour, then they thought they were ſafe. So in the time of darkeneſſe, the devill might let them doe their good workes, and what they liſt, and yet have them ſtill under his lure: that he might offend them at his pleaſure, that had no armour to reſiſt him. All the Children of God, had a right and property in the Law of God, as appeareth by Chriſts words, <hi>John</hi> 10.34. he anſwered them, that is, the common people, <hi>Is it not written in your Law?</hi> As though hee ſhould ſay, the Scripture is yours. To the young man (in the tenth Chapter of Saint <hi>Lukes</hi> Goſpell, and 26. verſe) that asked Chriſt, <hi>what he ſhould doe to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved?</hi> Chriſt anſwereth: <hi>What is written in the Law? how readeſt thou?</hi> Whereunto to anſwer, that we cannot read, or that the booke
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48000:372"/>is ſealed up, <hi>Eſay</hi> 29.11. is as the devill would have it. Then hath he a fit time to offer us ſtones to make bread of. But this anſwer with our Saviour Chriſt will not be allowed of.</p>
                           <p>Now come we to the ſpeciall point of Chriſts anſwer, <hi>It is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Man lives not by bread onely, &amp;c. Deut.</hi> 8.3. There is no better kinde of reaſoning, than that, when one grants all that hath beene ſaid by his adverſary, and proveth it to make on his part; and upon a new conceit, avoyds all that his adverſary ſaid. Here our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our might confeſſe all that the devill objected; as that he is the Son of God; and admit the ſtones were made bread, and that bread were of abſolute neceſſity, and that it were ſo to be come by (which is untrue) were we then in good caſe?</p>
                           <p>This indeed is the devils poſition, wherewith he would perſwade all thoſe that have <hi>animam triticeam,</hi> (as the Fathers call it) that thoſe externall things are neceſſary to be had: and that if they have enough thereof, they are well enough; as we ſee it to be the minde of the rich man, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.19. This man having a wheaten ſoule, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving corne enough, bade his <hi>ſoule take reſt,</hi> and live merrily <hi>for many yeares.</hi> But Chriſt goeth further, and ſaith; Though the ſtones be made bread, it will not availe, except it pleaſe God (by the bleſſing of his word) to give vertue, and (as it were) life unto the bread, there is no difference between it, and a ſtone.</p>
                           <p>It is not the plenty or quality of victuals, howſoever ſome dote upon ſuch externall meanes, as they did, which ſacrificed to their net, and burnt incenſe to their yerne, <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.16. becauſe by them their portion was fat, and their meates plenteous. For what ſaith <hi>Job</hi> 31.27. <hi>If I had rejoyced becauſe my ſubſtance was great, this had beene an iniquity.</hi> So that our life is not mainetained by bread onely, deſcended out of the mould of the earth. The nature of bread and ſtones are not much unlike, they come both out of one belly, that is to ſay, the earth, <hi>Job</hi> 28.5, 6. and of themſelves, the one of them hath no more power than the other unto life: for we know that the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> dyed, even while the fleſh of Quailes was in their mouthes, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.33. and <hi>Manna</hi> (heavenly fare) being farre better than our bread. It is the devils crafty policy, to bury a mans life under a loafe of bread: and (as it were) to fetter the grace of God to the outward meanes; wheras they of themſelves are of no more efficacy, without the operation and grace of the word, than a hammer and a ſaw, without a hand, able to employ them.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>David</hi> ſaith (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.28.) <hi>The eyes of all things waite on God for their meate in due ſeaſon, and thou filleſt them:</hi> With what? with bread? No, but <hi>with thy bleſsing and goodneſſe.</hi> Our hearts muſt be <hi>ſtabliſhed with grace, not with meats, Heb.</hi> 13.9. It is Gods prerogative, that as all things had their beginning from him, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.17. ſo he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth and ſuſtaineth them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                           <p>This is a further point than all Philoſophy teacheth us. For they having laid downe the foure elements, bare and ſimple eſſences, <hi>tanquam materiam,</hi> by compounding and tempering of them, they bring forth a certaine quinteſſence or balme full of vertue. But Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48000:373"/>leadeth ſo to a quinteſſence, without which, all the quinteſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and balmes in the world can doe us no good.</p>
                           <p>To the queſtion that <hi>Jeremie</hi> propoundeth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.22, <hi>Is there no balme at Gilead? Is there no Phyſitian there?</hi> The anſwer may bee. Mans health is not recovered by balme or phyſicke onely, <hi>but by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God,</hi> if we weigh Chriſts ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument aright. For we may ſee, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.12. <hi>Aſa</hi> dyed for all his Phyſitians that were about him. So if it be asked, Are there no horſes nor chariots in <hi>Gilead?</hi> We may anſwer, warlike victory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth not in warlike furniture onely, but in remembring the name of the Lord God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 20.7. A horſe is a vaine thing to ſave, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the power of this word. And ſo when a man thrives not, or proſpers not in his actions; it is not often for want of labour or care: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1. tels him, <hi>Except the Lord build the houſe, &amp;c. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> adviſeth his Auditory to beleeve it in time, leſt (by wofull experience) they finde it to be true; when as they ſhall have ſuch a conſumption, that no meate ſhall doe them any good; or ſuch a dropſie, that no drinke ſhall availe them. The power and vertue of this word is called, <hi>The ſtaffe of bread, Levit.</hi> 26.26. and it is meant of a chiefe ſtaffe, ſuch a one as is ſet in the middeſt, to beare up all the Tent. The plaineſt ſimilitude I can uſe, to make you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the force thereof is this: When we goe to Phyſicke for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſe, we are bidden feeth ſuch herbes in running water, and then to drinke the water, we know it is not the water which help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, but the decoction of infuſion. So it is not the bread (conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red barely in it ſelfe) that nouriſheth us, but the vertue and grace of the word infuſed into it. We are not therefore to ſticke to the meanes, like the Glutton, <hi>Luk.</hi> 12.19. but to pray for this bleſſing. And to this end, God (in the eſtabliſhing of nature) hath thereout reſerved foure ſpeciall prerogatives to his Word.</p>
                           <p>As firſt, with a very little of the meanes to goe farre in operation, 1 <hi>Reg.</hi> 17.14. with a little oyle and a little wheate, he fed <hi>Elias,</hi> the poore widdow, and her ſonne a great while. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.14. Chriſt made five loaves and two fiſhes ſerve five thouſand perſons. The heathen man thought no certaine proportion was to be ſet downe for a family, becauſe when a heavenly hunger commeth on men, they eate more at one time, than at another. But whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the heathen have ſpoken wiſely, we have farre more wiſely ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by the Holy Ghoſt, in one place or other. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. this is ſet downe, where there is mention made of a certaine hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, wherewith mens bellies be filled, and <hi>Hagg.</hi> 1.6. ſaith, <hi>Men eate much, yet have not enough; drinke much, but are not filled:</hi> This is the firſt prerogative.</p>
                           <p>His ſecond is, he takes order as well for the quality, as for the quantity; courſe meates and fine are all one with him; for the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> (notwithſtanding their Quayles and Manna) dyed; and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> and his fellowes, that fed upon courſe meates, looked better than all the children that were fed with the Kings owne dyet, <hi>Dan.</hi> 1.15.</p>
                           <pb facs="tcp:48000:373"/>
                           <p>Thirdly, without meanes he worketh ſometimes. Therefore <hi>Aſa</hi> had ſaid little or nothing to the purpoſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 14.11. If he had ſaid, <hi>God helpeth by many or few</hi> (if he had not put in too) <hi>and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by none.</hi> For there was light before any Sunne or Moone, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. though after (<hi>verſe</hi> 14.) it pleaſed God to ordaine them as inſtruments. And ſo <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5. the earth was fertile, when as then no raine had falne on the earth, not any ſuch ordinary meanes. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> be on the Mount, and but heare God, and hee needeth no bread.</p>
                           <p>The fourth is, that he can bring his purpoſe to paſſe, even by thoſe meanes, whoſe natures tend to contrary effects; as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve by ſtones. <hi>Colloquintida,</hi> being ranke poyſon, (in eating where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is preſent death) was (by the Prophet) made matter of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.40. So Chriſt, by thoſe things which were fit to put out a ſeeing mans eyes, as duſt; made a blinde man recover his ſight, <hi>John</hi> 9.6. And ſo doth hee make light to ſhine out of darkeneſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. One contrary out of another. Thus we ſee the devill anſwered. Now let us apply theſe things to our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>Chriſts anſwer doth import two words, and ſo two mouthes, and two breaths, or ſpirits: and theſe two be as two twinnes. He that will be maintained by the one, muſt ſeeke after the other. The firſt word is the ſame decree, whereby the courſe of nature is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, according to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.15. <hi>He ſendeth forth his commandement upon the earth, and his word runneth very ſwiftly: he giveth ſnow like wooll, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Secondly, the other is that whereof <hi>James</hi> 1.18. ſpeaketh: to wit, <hi>the word of truth,</hi> wherewith (of his owne will) he begat us. The one proceedeth from the mouth of Gods providence, crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and governing all things, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33.6. <hi>He but ſpake the word, and it was done.</hi> The other proceedeth out of the mouth of Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, who are (as it were) his mouth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Thou ſtandeſt before me, as if thou wert my mouth.</hi> From the firſt word, all things have their beginning and being; as when he ſent forth his ſpirit or breath, they were created and had their beginning: So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.29. He teacheth us, that ſo ſoone as God hides his face, they are troubled. And if he takes away their breath, they dye, and returne to duſt. The other ſpirit, that is, the ſanctifying Spirit, miniſtreth unto us ſupernaturall life, <hi>Eſay</hi> 56.21. Now therefore to ſet them together, every man is thus to thinke with himſelfe. If I get my li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving contrary to Gods word, that is, by any unlawfull meanes; ſurely Gods other word will not accompany ſuch gotten goods. That is, theſe two words be twinnes: if we get not our goods by the one word, we ſhall want the bleſſing of the other word, and than wee were as good eate ſtones: it will be but gravell in our mouthes, or Quailes. We are then to uſe the meanes, according to the ſecond word. <hi>Abraham</hi> (we ſee) went forth to ſacrifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods appointment, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. the Word was his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: therefore when <hi>Iſaac</hi> asked, <hi>Where was the Sacrifice?</hi> he might
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48000:374"/>boldly anſwer, <hi>God would provide one;</hi> as we ſee even at the very pinch he did: whereupon it came to be a proverbe, that even <hi>In monte, Jehova providebit.</hi> The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> went out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> by the warrant and appointment of Gods Word. How then? Firſt, they had a <hi>way</hi> made them (where never was any before) through the Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.21. they had <hi>bread</hi> downeward out of the clouds, whereas it uſeth to riſe upwards out of the earth: their garments in forty yeares never waxed old, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.3, 4. they had <hi>water,</hi> whence water uſeth not to come; by ſtriking the Rockes, water guſhed forth: So that it is true, which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.9. <hi>There is no want to them that feare God.</hi> Though (peradventure) he will not uſe the ſame meanes he did for the <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> yet the Children of God (walking after his will) ſhall have ſome way of reliefe alwayes. And therefore Chriſt would not diſtruſt the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God: for hee knew he was in the worke and way of God; For we read, <hi>That he was led into the Wilderneſſe by the Spirit,</hi> and therefore could not lacke; as indeed he did not, for the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels came and miniſtred unto him: as it followeth in the 11. verſe of this Chapter. So either the Crowes ſhall miniſter to our wants, as they did to <hi>Elias:</hi> or our enemies, as the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did to the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites:</hi> or elſe the Angels themſelves, as they did here.</p>
                           <p>But to grow to a concluſion, <hi>Let us ſeeke the Kingdome of God, and all other things ſhall be miniſtred unto us.</hi> And in all like temptations, we may learne a good anſwer out of <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.17. <hi>That God that we ſerve is able to relieve and deliver us, even from the burning fire:</hi> But, if it ſhould not be his will ſo to doe, yet wee will not uſe unlawfull meanes, or fall to Idolatry, or turne ſtones into bread. In this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer (againe) Chriſt would teach us heare to be reſolute, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Gods bleſſing doth not concurre with our gettings, as it doth not when we get them by indirect meanes, contrary to Gods word. To goods ſo gotten, God will adde ſorrow: for <hi>The bleſsing of the Lord maketh rich, and he doth adde no ſorrowes with it, Prov.</hi> 10.22. When God gives riches, he gives quietneſſe withall: but if God give them not, we were as good be without them, whether they be gotten by oppreſſion or violence, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.17. or by fraud and deceit, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17. For theſe two be the quick-ſilver and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone of the devils Alchymiſtry. God will adde ſorrow to them, for though they be pleaſant at the firſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.17. and money got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſtinking meanes, ſmels like other money (as an Emperour ſaid:) and bread ſo gotten, taſtes like other bread: yet in the end a plaine concluſion and experiment will make it manifeſt, that it was made of ſtones, and had ſorrow mingled or added to it. And therefore it ſhall be either an occaſion or matter of the diſeaſe cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Stone:</hi> or it ſhall turne his meate in his bowels, and <hi>fill him with the gall of Aſpes, Job</hi> 20.14. or as <hi>Aſaes</hi> oppreſſion by delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, became an occaſion of the dropſie or gout: or elſe ſhall the executioner catch all that hee hath, and the ſtranger ſpoyle him, <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 109.11. or ſpend them upon Phyſitians, <hi>Marke</hi> 5.26. or on Lawyers: or elſe, though God ſuffer them to enjoy them quietly
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48000:374"/>all their life time, and even to dye by their fleſh pots; yet on their death-bed, they ſhall finde ſuch a grudging and torment in their conſcience, that they will wiſh that they had ſtarved for hunger, before they had begunne to uſe any ſuch meanes. Or if God in his judgement (for their greater torment) ſuffer them to dye in their beds, without any remorſe of conſcience, like blockes, or like an Oxe dying in a ditch; at the laſt day they ſhall feele a gnaſhing in their teeth, and then they will know it was made of ſtones.</p>

                                 <p>And ſaid unto him, If thou be the Sonne of God, caſt thy ſelfe downe: for it is written, that he will give his Angels charge over thee, and with their hands they ſhall lift thee up, leſt at any time thou ſhouldſt daſh thy foote againſt a ſtone.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE manner is, after one hath taken a foyle, his courage will faile. The Angell would have beene gone, when he ſaw he could not prevaile over <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 32.26. But it is not ſo here with the devill. For when he ſaw that his firſt temptation would not prevaile, he tryeth another. And even ſo he played with <hi>Job:</hi> for when he could doe no good upon his firſt Patent, by taking away all he had, he comes and ſues for a new Commiſſion, that he might touch his fleſh and bones, <hi>Job</hi> 2.5. and thereby he giveth us to learne, That it is not one foyle that can make him give over. He is one of thoſe, whom a Father ſaith, to have courage above their ſtrength; and of that nature be many in our dayes, whoſe daring is above their skill; and have courage to undertake much more than their ability is to performe. Not like <hi>David,</hi> who did as much as he undertooke in killing <hi>Goliah:</hi> nor like him of whom <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth verſe of his third Chapter, that when they would have made him Prince, he had <hi>no bread nor cloathing,</hi> and therefore refuſed: but they will take it upon them, though they have not wherewith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and thereby become Authors of trouble, wanting ability to goe through withall. But as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith; Is it not all one not to be able to anſwer, nor to be able to hold their peace? We ſee here the devill is a great undertaker.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, he is not onely content to take a foyle, but even out of the ſame thing wherewith he was foyled, maketh he matter of a new Temptation, a new ball of fire: Out of Chriſts conqueſt, he makes a new aſſault; that is, ſince he will needs truſt, he will ſet him on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48000:375"/>truſting; he ſhall truſt as much as he will. As the former tempted him to diffidence; ſo this ſhall tempt him to preſidence. As before the devill brought him to the waters of <hi>Meribah</hi> (<hi>Exod.</hi> 17.7.) where the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did murmure and tempt God: ſo now he brings him to the temptation of <hi>Maſſah,</hi> (<hi>Deut.</hi> 6.16.) that is, to preſumption, wantonneſſe, and delicacy: for then with bread they were not content, but they muſt have fleſh and other dainties, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.20. As the firſt might be called the <hi>hungry Temptation,</hi> ſo this may be called, <hi>The wanton Temptation.</hi> That which was in the old Teſtament the Temptation of <hi>Meribah,</hi> is here in the new Teſtament the Temptation of the Wilderneſſe; and that which was there the Temptation of <hi>Maſſah,</hi> is here the temptation of the Pinacle.</p>
                           <p>In the firſt, by want of things neceſſary, he thought to drive them to vexation and bitterneſſe of ſpirit, and to diſtruſt Gods power and goodneſſe. In the ſecond, by unneceſſary matters, he draweth us on to wantonneſſe, and to put God to try what he can doe, and to ſet him about baſe ſervices: by the one, he driveth us unto unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes, by the other, he draweth us from the uſe of things law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: by the one he brings us to this conceit, that we are ſo abject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God, that if we truſt in him, he will in the end faile us; by the other to thinke we are ſo deare in Gods eyes, and ſuch darlings, as throw our ſelves into any danger, and he will not forſake us. By the one, he puts us in feare, (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith) <hi>Deum defuturum, etiam ſi promiſit;</hi> by the other, in hope, <hi>Deum adfuturum, ubi non promiſit:</hi> by the one, he ſlandereth God unto us, as if he were a God of ſtraw, of baſe condition, and ſubject to our becke; by the other, as if he were a God of iron, that would not encline, though we requeſted him.</p>
                           <p>Now to the Temptation: wherein we are to conſider three things. Firſt, the ground the devill choſe for the working of this temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Secondly, the temptation it ſelfe; to wit, the devils ſpeech. Thirdly, Chriſts anſwer to it. In the place, three things are to be noted: Firſt, the place it ſelfe: Secondly, the devill choſe it: Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that our Saviour followed him thither. For a new temptation he makes choyce of a new place. Indeed for a temptation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, the Wilderneſſe was not a fit place: Firſt, it was not high enough, and then it was not populous enough. It was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy place: when a man is under the croſſe in affliction, or in ſome anguiſh and ſorrow for want, death of friends, or otherwiſe, and generally for all ſolitary men, the <hi>hungry Temptation</hi> is fitter than this of <hi>Preſumption.</hi> As long as <hi>Noah</hi> was in the Arke in the midſt of the waters, he had in him no preſumptuous thought: but ſitting under the Vine in his Vineyard, he was overcome therewith. And juſt <hi>Lot</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8.) in <hi>Sodom,</hi> had no fit time or place to be preſumptuous; but when he dwelt in the mountaine in ſecurity, then he committed inceſt with his daughters, being made drunke by them. <hi>David,</hi> ſo long as he was perſecuted by <hi>Saul,</hi> and toſſed up and downe from poſt to pillar, had no leiſure to be preſumptuous: but in the top of his Turret, when he was at reſt in his Palace, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi>
                              <pb n="28" facs="tcp:48000:376"/>11.2. preſumption gave him a blow. So here the Wilderneſſe was no fit place, but the Pinacle is a very fit place for one to be preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous on. It is as good as a ſtage to ſhew himſelfe upon, to ſee and to be ſeene.</p>
                           <p>In the Wilderneſſe there was ſmall warrant for one that would be preſumptuous: but from the Pinacle hee might diſcerne farre and neere, both the inner Court and outward Court, and ſee a whole Cloud of Witneſſes, and have ſome warrant of example of all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates, high or low, wiſe or noble. For what abuſe ſoever be in him, be he never ſo preſumptuous, he ſhall ſee ſome as proud, ſtout, and high-minded as himſelfe: be his haire never ſo long, or his ruffes never ſo great, he ſhall finde ſome as farre gone therein as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe.</p>
                           <p>If we marke the foure gradations that it hath, we ſhall finde it to be a very fit place. As
<list>
                                 <item>firſt, before he could come to the Pinacle, he muſt goe out of the Wilderneſſe into the City:</item>
                                 <item>Secondly, not any City, but the holy City:</item>

                                 <item>And fourthly, out of the Temple up to the Pinacle.</item>
                              </list> Firſt, (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got him to leave the Wilderneſſe) he brought him into the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that there he might ſay unto him: You ſee ſuch and ſuch grave men, how they behave themſelves: why ſhould you ſeeke to be holier than they? This was a good civill temptation: he brought him not to <hi>Ceſarea</hi> or <hi>Samaria,</hi> but even to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> the <hi>holy City:</hi> for that addition is given it, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.9. and <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. Thirdly, he brought him into the Temple, where even the very ground was holy. Fourthly, not to any other place of it, but the very top and Pinacle, which was over the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> Who would not tread hard there, and take upon him, being in ſuch a place? where if a man will be carryed away with example, he may ſee <hi>Ananias</hi> the High-Prieſt, renting his cloathes, at the hearing of things that ſounded like blaſphemy, <hi>Mark.</hi> 14.63. and yet buying his Biſhoprick for money; who will not then be bold to doe the like? And <hi>Herod</hi> a Prince, ſuch a one as heard <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> Preach; yea, and with <hi>much delight,</hi> to commit adultery, <hi>Marke</hi> 6.20. who would feare to doe the like? There he may ſee the Phariſee, under ſhew of great holineſſe, tything <hi>Mint</hi> and <hi>Cummin,</hi> and under colour of long pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, devoure Widowes houſes, bringing in by extortion, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out by exceſſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.14.21. And ſo in this City, one may ſee ſome men, both great frequenters of Sermons, and yet great U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurers; Gentlewomen, miſ-ſhapen in their attire. Seeing this, who will not be as bold as they, the place being ſo holy? And being thus warranted by example, ſurely we muſt needes commend the devils wit, for his choyce.</p>
                           <p>Out of this, ariſe two notes. Firſt, againſt ſome phantaſticall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, who ſay; Can that be an holy City, where there be dumbe dogges? There were ſo in <hi>Jeruſalem, Eſay</hi> 56.10. Where the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders be blinde; <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.14. They were ſo where <hi>Judas</hi> miniſtred the Sacrament; where there is div<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ſion and debate amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.2. Can this, (ſay they) be the holy City? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48000:376"/>upon they forſake the fellowſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25. Whereas they (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the former abuſes, and notwithſtanding the eleven Tribes were Apoſtates) did yet name it the holy City.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, on the other ſide we are to be inſtructed, though a man be on the battlements of the Church, yet hath he no ſure footing, or cauſe to be ſecure; but rather to feare the more: for even there doth the devill ſtand at his elbow, watching his overthrow. There is no place we ſee priviledged from temptations, no Deſert ſo ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the devill will ſeeke it out: no Pinacle ſo high, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill is a Biſhop over it, to viſit and over-looke it.</p>
                           <p>To conclude, though in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſits the <hi>abomination of deſolation</hi> (whereof <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpake;) yet it is the holy City ſtill. And though the place be never ſo holy, yet is that no cauſe of priviledge; but even there may ſit <hi>the abomination of deſolation.</hi> Both are proved out of <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.15.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond thing that we obſerved in the circumſtance of place, is; that the Devill aſſumpted Chriſt: which, to thoſe that are weake (as <hi>Gregory</hi> alſo collecteth) may be offenſive, in giving them to thinke, that the devill had ſuch power over Chriſt, as to carry him whither he liſted. But when they ſhall conſider, that even the limbes of the devill haled and harrowed him to and fro, from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiphas</hi> to <hi>Pilat,</hi> from <hi>Pilat</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> and from him backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to <hi>Pilat:</hi> and how ſpitefully and contemptuouſly he was uſed in all theſe places, and at laſt carryed to execution: what marvell will it be to ſee him (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh) <hi>In monte duci à capite, qui àmembris traditur, &amp;c.</hi> Theſe things doe indeed (as all other his ſufferings) ſet forth the greatneſſe of the love of God toward us. Of God the Father, that he would give his onely Sonne; yea, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point him this worke of our ſalvation, and give the devill ſuch a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer over him, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.53. Of God the Sonne, that he would be content to ſuffer ſuch indignity, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. as to be <hi>obedient to the death of the Croſſe.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The reaſon of all theſe his ſufferings, as alſo that he would be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of <hi>John,</hi> a weake and ſinfull man; was (as himſelfe declareth it) to <hi>fulfill all righteouſneſſe, Matth.</hi> 3.15. So here he was to ſuffer it, elſe Gods righteouſneſſe would not have beene fulfilled, nor the worke of our ſalvation. And as he ſuffered this Aſſumption, ſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Luke.</hi> 9.51. his ſecond Aſſumption was, to goe to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> to ſuffer: and ſo at the laſt he came to his third and laſt Aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption, to be received up into glory, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. And by the very ſame ſteps and degrees, muſt we be aſſumpted. And this is the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of ſuffering, which brought him to glorifying.</p>
                           <p>The third thing is, that our Saviour followed; whereby we are to marke, not ſo much his courage, that he durſt encounter with the devill, in any place whereſoever he liſt to carry him: and that he was not onely the God of the vallies, but a God of the mountaines alſo, contrary to their ſurmiſe, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.23. That (I ſay) is not ſo much to be marked, as that our Saviour would at all ſtand upon a Pinacle. There be ſome that would make us beleeve, it is a ſin to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48000:377"/>ſtand upon a Pinacle: but then if that had beene ſo, Chriſt would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have ſtood there. And ſince Chriſt ſtood there, it is no more ſin for any man elſe to ſtand there, than it is to ſtand in the Wilderneſſe: for it is lawfull for us to follow his foot-ſteps, and to tread whereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oever he hath trod before us; yet ſuch places be not priviledged. For, as it is true, that many mens table and wealth is their ſnare, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.22. even ſo the good gifts and graces of God, be turned to a mans hurt: as knowledge may ſerve for a quill to puffe him up and make him ſwell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.1. Nay, even that godly ſorrow, which is ſo much to be wiſhed for, hath in it matter of temptation, leſt men be ſwallowed up with two much heavineſſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7.</p>
                           <p>The Scriptures themſelves (we ſee) are ſubject to the abuſe of the devill: whereby it ſhould follow, that they are to be refuſed, if eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing be refuſed which brings matter of temptation. But as <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non eſt laus ſtetiſſe in pinaculo, ſed ſtetiſſe &amp; non cecidiſſe.</hi> In every place to anſwer the devill, is praiſe-worthy. Indeed it is dangerous for one that hath a light and giddy braine, for ſuch as are drunke, <hi>Eſay</hi> 51.22. (though not with wine) to ſtand ſo high. <hi>Job</hi> could ſtand there without falling, for he had a more ſetled braine, <hi>Job</hi> 31.27. Such places are for the wiſeſt and ſageſt men. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſtood not there, but yet he could have ſtood there, for he had the tricke, or skill of it, as himſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12. <hi>I can be abaſed, and I can abound, &amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Now come we to the Temptation it ſelfe, which hath three gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall heads. Firſt, the ball of wilde-fire; which is to conſume his faith. Secondly, the dart, <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe;</hi> which is to pierce the ſoule. Thirdly, he tempereth the head of his dart with ſome ſtronger me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; which is, <hi>Scriptum eſt.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>I. Firſt, <hi>Si filius Dei es.</hi> This is a great moate in the devils eye, he uſeth the ſame terme in the former temptation, and here he is up with it againe. And all is to this end, that by often bringing it into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whether he be the Sonne of God; he may at laſt make it out of queſtion or doubt, that we are not the Sonnes of God: that by, and from <hi>Si ſis,</hi> he may bring it to <hi>Ne ſis;</hi> and ſo we may be like himſelfe. For to this end is all his compaſſing of Sea and Land, to make one Proſelyte like himſelfe, according to the endeavour of the Phariſees, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.15. who did in like ſort; and when he is made, yee make him twofold more the childe of hell, than your ſelves. As on the other ſide, Chriſt would have us the Sonnes of God like him. But ſee what a dexterity the devill hath, in making things ſerve for his purpoſe: he maketh one ſelfe-ſame thing ſerve for two ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, yea, contrary purpoſes. What a goodly grace he hath in the firſt Temptation? He uſeth it there to procure us to deſparation: He maketh it here to ſerve for preſumption. But indeed there be two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of <hi>Si es,</hi> or <hi>Ifs:</hi> the one is a queſtioning or doubting <hi>[Si;]</hi> as, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God, ſhew us a ſigne, Marke</hi> 8.12. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me whole, Mat.</hi> 8.2. The other is a plaine affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11. <hi>If by any meanes I might attaine to the reſurrection of the dead,</hi> where we are ſure he made no doubt thereof. So here
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48000:377"/>the devill ſaith, <hi>If thou be the Sonne of God,</hi> as I now grant indeed. I was in ſome doubt, but now. I confeſſe thou art: I am of that voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces minde, that deonounced thee ſo at thy Baptiſme.</p>
                           <p>The devill (in the former temptation) came out like a malecontent, or a murmurer: here he comes like a flattering paraſite, he will <hi>pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guare caput ejus oleo,</hi> make his head even ſwim in the oyle of oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But though it be not the ſame temptation, yet it is the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill in both places. For both by the one and the other, he ſeeketh the downfall and deſtruction of man: and though his two <hi>Ifs</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in themſelves, yet are they both alſo contrary to the will and Word of God: for he would not in any caſe we ſhould diſtruſt him, neither would he that at any time we ſhould caſt our ſelves downe. And therefore hath he cauſed battlements to be made on every houſe top, that none might be ſlaine with falling downe; <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. Now he would have him ſhew himſelfe (thereby) to be the Sonne of God, for he is now in the ſight of all <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>It is ſaid, that Chriſt comes now to put to a ſparke of fire, that is of faith, and that his will was, it might burne and be maintained. The devill on the other ſide, labours by all meanes poſſible to quench and put it out: and ſeeing water would not doe it in the former tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation; he goeth now about to ſee, if he can make the very oyle it ſelfe to put it out, even that very thing whereby it was to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: as indeed it will, if we powre out too great a quantity. Or if he cannot quench it, either with water or oyle, he will ſee if he can blow it up with gun-powder. As, ſeeing the water of diſtruſt will not extinguiſh his faith, but that he would truſt in God: he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voureth now by Scriptures (that magnifie the providence of God, and the confidence we are to put in him) to ſet him as farre gone in the other extreame, by preſuming or truſting too much, that ſo the fire, which before he would have quenched, may now ſo flame out, as not to keepe it ſelfe within the chimney, but to ſet the whole houſe on fire. This is the ball of wilde-fire of this ſecond Temptation: and ſo both we ſee tend to the conſuming and nullifying of our faith.</p>
                           <p n="2">II. The dart it ſelfe is, <hi>[Caſt thy ſelfe downe:]</hi> which conſiſteth of two points. Firſt, the caſting downe. Secondly, that he himſelfe was to caſt downe himſelfe. For the firſt, it is generall, the neglect of ordinary meanes, as here. Whereas the ordinary way was downe the ſtaires, he would have him leape, or throw himſelfe over the Battlements. And here a man may ſee to what end the devils halting commeth: he brings a man up by little and little to ſome high place, that ſo he may ſend him at once with his head downward. All the preferments that he beſtoweth on a man, is not to any other intent, but that he may doe as the devill himſelfe did, (who being on high did caſt himſelfe downe) and ſo be like him, <hi>John</hi> 8.23. that is, from beneath, not from above: who fell from heaven like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.18. So that howſoever in outward ſhew he may ſeem to befriend us, yet this is inward intention and ſcope. As the <hi>Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi> in time of the proſperity of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> pretended great good will to them: but in the day of their great calamity, they were they
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48000:378"/>that cryed, <hi>Downe with them, downe with them, Pſal.</hi> 137.7. Gods manner is, when he meaneth to exalt a man, he will firſt humble him, and make him low, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.12. The devils manner is (we ſee) cleane contrary, <hi>Eſay</hi> 14.14. to lift them up to the clouds, that he may bring them downe to the grave, yea to the loweſt grave, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86.13. He carryeth them the higher, to throw them downe with the greater violence. He lifteth up <hi>Adam</hi> with a conceit, to be like God, to the very top of perfection, to the intent he might be like the beaſt that periſheth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond hath ſome matter of comfort: the devill is here a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor to him, to doe it himſelfe. Why doth not the devill caſt him downe? Firſt, it was not in his power; or, if he had, yet would not that have ſerved his turne: then there had beene no ſinne of preſumption in it. There muſt be two perſons that muſt concurre in our downefall: well may the devill induce and move us to it; but unleſſe we our ſelves be conſenting, and caſt our ſelves downe, there can be no down-fall to hurt us. For as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Nemo laedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur niſi à ſeipſo:</hi> ſo, <hi>Nullum praecipitium niſi voluntarium.</hi> The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill did not cram <hi>Eve</hi> with the forbidden fruite: but when ſhe ſaw it, ſhe tooke it, and eate it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.6. So the devill, when he entreth into the ſoule of a man (which he counteth his palace) he doth not breake open the doore; no, nor ſo much as draw the latch; but when he commeth, he <hi>findeth it ſwept and garniſhed, Luke</hi> 11.25. and ſo goeth in. There muſt therefore be a reaching out of the hand, and an opening of the doore by our ſelves, and ſo a caſting downe of thy ſelfe, or elſe, though the devill thruſt ſore at thee that thou maiſt fall, the Lord will helpe thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 118.13. In <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.8. God hath cauſed battlements to be made on every houſe top, by which we may ſtay our ſelves. The devill tels God, that he had made a hedge about <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 1.10. ſo that unleſſe <hi>Job</hi> ſtep over it, or breake it downe, he is ſafe.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. The devils dart is, <hi>Caſt thy ſelfe downe:</hi> but he beſtoweth ſome great coſt on this. With the ſelfe-ſame armour that Chriſt bare off the other dart, doth the devill ſharpen and harden this: he doth not ſo in any other of the temptations, therefore we are to looke for ſome great matter: he bringeth Scripture, that he may be the better credited. He ſpeakes not now <hi>after the manner of men,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.8. ſo that it is not he now that ſpeaketh, but Scripture, as <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoneth there, <hi>You ſee</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I counſell you to nothing, but that the Pſalmes will beare you out in.</hi> The devill knew well by his owne fall, how dangerous the ſinne of preſumption is, it coſt him dearely: and ſo did it <hi>David</hi> likewiſe, and therefore of all other, he prayeth God to <hi>keepe him from preſumptuous ſinnes, Pſal.</hi> 19.13. He knew alſo what it was to abuſe the goodneſſe, patience, and long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.4. Therefore he avoucheth it by Scripture, he tels him, it will be too long to goe downe the ſtaires, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all teacheth him a neerer way, but to jump, or to caſt himſelf down, and to feare no hurt, for the Angels have charge of him. And even ſo he perſwadeth men now adayes; that they need not goe downe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48000:378"/>faire and ſoftly, in feare and trembling, but to deferre all till their dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houre, and then commend themſelves to God, and throw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon Gods mercy, and that fiery Chariot that tooke up <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> ſhall come and fetch up them; or elſe, an Angell ſhall carry them up, let them be ſure they ſhall have no harme, for they be Gods darlings, and God doth ſo dote on them, that he will not ſuffer them in any caſe to receive the leaſt hurt that may be.</p>
                           <p>If ever the devill came in his likeneſſe, it was here, In the firſt of <hi>Sam.</hi> 28.18. he came but in the guiſe of a Prophet: ſo that in ſtead of ſaying, <hi>Is Saul among the Prophets?</hi> it might have beene ſaid; What, is the devill among the Prophets? But here he hath uſed himſelfe ſo cunningly, that if ever he was transformed <hi>into an Angell,</hi> here it is verifyed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.14. For he commeth here like a white devill, or like a Divine; he comes with a Pſalter in his hand, and turnes to the place, and ſhewes our Saviour the 91. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> the 11, and 12. <hi>ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</hi> Wherein firſt we are to note, that the devill readeth <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> as well as we, and hath the words of Scripture in his mouth. And 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 28. he counterfeited <hi>Samuel</hi> ſo right, and uſed the very words that he had uſed, that they could not know him from <hi>Samuel:</hi> ſo here he counterfeited the voyce of <hi>David, Act.</hi> 19.15. This will make us ſhake off ſecurity, conſidering that God doth (for our tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all) ſometime deliver the adverſary the key of our Armory, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is able to hold argument with an Arch-angell, <hi>Jude</hi> 9. yea, with Chriſt himſelfe, as we ſee here. How carefull therefore had we need to be, to finde out a fit anſwer for him? For onely to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault us doth he reade the Scriptures: yea, but not to any good end, but even thereby to deceive the ſimplicity of men; as here to make them put their ſoules in adventure to the laſt houre. He hath indeed a grace with ſome vaine youths of the Count, and ungodly Atheiſts, to ſet them a ſcoffing at the Scripture, as <hi>Eſay</hi> 28.22. But with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that have the Scriptures in more high reverence, he goeth an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other way to worke, making it to them the favour of death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.10.</p>
                           <p>The words which he uſeth in the name of <hi>Samuel,</hi> hee uſeth to make <hi>Saul</hi> deſpaire: and here he uſeth <hi>Davids</hi> words to cauſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and to make them our bane. And not every Scripture: but if there be any Scripture more full of heavenly comfort than an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, that of all other will the devill abuſe; as indeed the <hi>Pſalmes</hi> are; and of all the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> this 91. eſpecially: and in that part, if any one ſentence be ſweeter than another, that of all other will the devill abuſe. Marke the ſecond verſe here cited: <hi>Hee ſhall give his Angels charge over thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes.</hi> Theſe laſt words the devill leaves out, becauſe they make not for his purpoſe. <hi>They ſhall beare thee in their hands, that thou daſh not thy foote againſt a ſtone.</hi> And we ſhall ſee nothing can be ſpoken more comfortable: as firſt, in that it is ſaid, that the Angels have charge over us in all our wayes, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.20. <hi>Behold, I ſend my Angel before thee, to guide thee in the way;</hi> and to comfort, and confirme us. As when <hi>Jacob</hi> was in feare of his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> the Angel met him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.1. and to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48000:379"/>defend us in all dangers, and ſuccour us in all neceſſities, ſpreading their wings over us, and pitching their tents about us; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.7. Secondly, this charge not onely concerneth our head and principall members, but alſo our feet: yea, Gods providence reacheth even to the haires of our head, for they are numbred, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.30. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this charge of theirs is not onely to admoniſh us when danger commeth, but they are actually to helpe us, as it were putting their hands betweene the ground and us, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.14. They ſhall take the rubs and offences out of our way. Fourthly, this doe they not of curteſie, as being creatures given by nature to love mankind, but by ſpeciall mandate and charge, they are bound to it, and have a <hi>praecipe</hi> for it, yea, the very beaſts and ſtones ſhall be in league with us.</p>
                           <p>This <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and theſe verſes containing ſuch comfort, hath the devill culled to perſwade men, that being ſuch ſweete children of God, they may venture whether, and upon what they will; for the Angels attend them, at an inch. He bids them put the matter in adventure, and then but whiſtle for an Angell, and they will come at firſt: he carryeth them up to the top of the Pinacle, and ſhewes them their owne caſe in <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Herod;</hi> and tels them God will require no more of them, than he did at their hands: and all the way as they goe up, he ſingeth them a <hi>Pſalme</hi> of the mercies of God: he carryeth them up with a ſong, that <hi>Gods mercy is above al his workes, Pſal.</hi> 145.9. And with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.8. <hi>How gracious and long-ſuffering God is, who rewardeth us not according to our deſerts,</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136. <hi>That his mercy endureth for ever:</hi> God therefore being ſo full of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, will take all things in good part. But this mercy the devill tels them of, differeth from the mercy <hi>David</hi> meant. For the mercy <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaketh of, is coupled with judgement, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 101.1. <hi>I will ſing mercy and judgement to thee, O Lord.</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10. <hi>Mercy and Truth are met together, Juſtice and Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> Thus, I ſay, they ſhall have muſicke all the way, and if any at the height thinke it a great way downe: no (ſaith the devill) you need but a jumpe from your baptiſme into heaven, you ſhall need no ſtaires at all.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>onſidering that Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.5. <hi>The Scripture ſpeaketh nothing in vaine:</hi> and that as our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. <hi>No Scripture can be diſappointed;</hi> it may ſeeme ſtrange that the devill comming armed with <hi>The Sword of the Spirit,</hi> (for ſo is the Word of God termed, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 6.17.) Chriſt gives not place, but oppoſeth himſelfe to anſwer. We ſee that a meſſage comming in the name of the Lord, this very name abaſhed <hi>Nehemias,</hi> (<hi>Neh.</hi> 6.10.) at the firſt hearing, till he perceived it was contrary to the Law of God, and ſo came not from him: which here we ſee to be the cauſe, why Chriſt doth not yeeld by and by, upon the hearing of the Word, but ſets himſelfe to make anſwer: forſomuch as the word is not of, <hi>Quia dicitur</hi> onely, but <hi>Quia creditur,</hi> as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> noteth. If there be not the mixture of faith with it, (whereof <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2.) it is nothing worth. And therefore the bad ſpirit was nothing abaſhed or daunted at the hearing of the bare names of <hi>Jeſus</hi> and <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 19.15. but anſwered, <hi>I know them, but who are ye?</hi> They did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, and therefore could doe them no good, but were wounded themſelves: glorious names would not ſerve the turne. So was it here uſed without faith. When the Scripture is here urged againſt one, a man would thinke it were not to be anſwered by citing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther place of Scripture, but by ſome tradition of the Elders, <hi>Mark.</hi> 7.1. or ſome gloſſe, or other ſhift; but we ſee our Saviour anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth here no other way but by Scripture. Becauſe, the Woolfe comes ſometimes diſguiſed in a ſheepes skinne, it is no reaſon that therefore the very ſheepe ſhould lay away their fleeces: ſo here, becauſe the devill uſeth the Word, as the ſlaying Letter, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. or as the ſword to kill men with; it is no reaſon why Chriſt may not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48000:380"/>uſe it in his owne defence. Why then (will ſome ſay) one of theſe two inconveniencies will follow; that hereby we ſhall thinke the Scripture is of the devils ſide, aſwell as of Chriſts ſide; and ſo divided; as in like ſort they make a diviſion of Chriſt, when one holds with <hi>Paul,</hi> another with <hi>Apollos,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. No, it is not ſo, Chriſt alledgeth not this Scripture in that ſort, as one nayle to drive out another: but by way of harmony and expoſition, that the one may make plaine the meaning of the other. For, albeit the devill ſheweth himſelfe to be the devill, in citing that Text ſo, as might beſt ſerve for his purpoſe: in that, whereas the <hi>Pſalme</hi> whereout he taketh it, hath it thus; <hi>That he might keepe him in all his wayes;</hi> which words he leaveth out. For if he had cited that, he could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have enforced any caſting downe. For the Angels have no charge over a man, but in his wayes; and from the top of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle there was no way, but downe the ſtaires on his feete. He was not (relying on the Angels) to caſt himſelfe downe with his head forward. But the devill hath a wreſt to make the ſtring ſound high or low, as he liſt; or if that will not ſerve, he hath a racke to ſtretch them out, as ſome did Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. He can ſet them on the tenters, to prove, that downe the ſtaires, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the battlements, all is one, the Angels ſhall ſafe-guard him. Though this (I ſay) be the devils corruption, which the late wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have well ſpyed: yet Chriſt (we ſee) is not willing to take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of that, but uſeth a wiſer courſe; for ſo are we to thinke, that he went the beſt way to worke; that is, the conference of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Scripture, which Chriſt here practiſeth, and commendeth unto us.</p>
                           <p>In every Art, all propoſitions are not of a like certainty, but ſome be grounds and principles, ſo certaine, as that no exception is to be taken againſt them. From them are others derived, by a conſequence called <hi>Deduction,</hi> not ſo certaine as the other: from theſe againe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the twentieth hand. So is it in Divinity. Chriſt here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the devils argument and place, to a place moſt plaine to be confeſſed. For the Jewes valuing of the meaning, had to conſider, that God fed them with <hi>Manna,</hi> which they knew not, to teach them that <hi>Man liveth not by bread onely, Deut.</hi> 8.3. contemning the ſame: and in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.16. bade them, <hi>They ſhould not tempt their Lord their God,</hi> as in <hi>Maſſah,</hi> when they cryed for bread. The Lord curſeth him, that maketh fleſh his arme, and with-draweth his heart from God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5. They ſacrificed unto their yarne, becauſe their portion was plentifull, <hi>Habak.</hi> 1.16. <hi>Job</hi> condemneth the making <hi>gold our hope,</hi> or the <hi>wedge of gold our confidence,</hi> Chap. 31.24. As then we muſt not defie the meanes, attributing all-ſufficiency to them: ſo we may not nullifie them, and think too baſely of them, but uſe them that we tempt not God, according to his word.</p>
                           <p>Out of theſe two grounds, may every queſtion be reſolved: for every propoſition muſt be proved out of the ground. So that, as we may not thinke the arme of God to be ſo ſhortned, that he cannot helpe without meanes: ſo are we not to thinke baſely of God, for
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48000:380"/>ordaining meanes. Secondly, we heard, that the devils allegation was taken out of the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> and one of the moſt comfortable places of the <hi>Pſalme.</hi> Chriſt, by not ſtanding in Diſputation about the words and meaning of the Text, commendeth to us the ſafeſt and wiſeſt way to make anſwer in ſuch like caſes. Our Saviour would warne us, that the 91. <hi>Pſalme</hi> is not fit matter for us to ſtudy on, when we are on the toppe of the Pinacle: he therefore chuſeth a place of a contrary kind, to counterpoiſe himſelfe ſtanding in that fickle place. The <hi>Law</hi> (we know) is a great cooler to <hi>preſumption.</hi> If one tam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per much with the <hi>Pſalmes,</hi> being in caſe of confidence, he may make the fire too bigge. Faith, is the fire which Chriſt came to put on the earth, and it is ſeated betweene two extreames, <hi>Diſtruſt,</hi> and <hi>Preſumption.</hi> Diſtruſt is as water to it, which, if it be powred on in abundance, it will make it to be ſmoaking flaxe, or utterly quench it. Preſumption (on the other ſide) is as Gunpowder to it, which being throwne into it, it will blow it up, and make it flye all about the houſe. Chriſt was to take heed of over-heating his Faith. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> upon the <hi>Galatians</hi> ſaith, the 91. <hi>Pſalme</hi> is no meete ſtudy for many mens humours in our dayes: they had more need of a corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, to eate out the ſore from the roote and bottome.</p>
                           <p>Now to the anſwer, which conſiſteth of ſixe points.

                           <p n="1">I. Firſt, whoſoever will not uſe ſuch ordinary meanes as God hath appointed, tempteth God: If he uſe extraordinary, (as here the devill would have Chriſt doe) when no body went about to thruſt him downe, wilfully to have caſt himſelfe downe, were great madneſſe: or when a man hath a faire paire of ſtaires to goe downe by, to call for a <hi>Cherub</hi> to carry him, or for the <hi>wind, to fly downe, Pſal.</hi> 18.10. were as great wantonneſſe.</p>
                           <p>There is an humour in man, that we are all given unto by nature; to be marvellouſly deſirous to try concluſions in matters that are rare and unknowne unto them; contemning things common, and to be fond after ſtrange novelties. It was told them as plaine as could be, that they ſhould not reſerve of the <hi>Manna till morning,</hi> and they nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not to have reſerved it; they had <hi>freſh every day:</hi> and yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth, they would needs keepe it, if it were but for an experiment ſake, to try whether it would ſtinke or no, <hi>Exod.</hi> 10.20. And though they were forbidden to gather on the Sabbath day, and on the Ee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had enough for two dayes, and it was told them, <hi>they ſhould find none;</hi> yet they muſt needs try. When a thing cannot be had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out great difficulty, it is our manner to have a vehement longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it: as when <hi>David</hi> was in a Hold, and the Garriſons of the <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtims</hi> were in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> then being thirſty, no water would ſerve his turne, but that in <hi>Bethlem,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23.15. But when three mighty men had broken into the hoſt of the <hi>Philiſtims,</hi> and had brought him of it, he cared not for it,</p>
                           <pb n="38" facs="tcp:48000:381"/>
                           <p n="2">II. For the ſecond, we are to know, that where neede is (as the Heathen ſpeaketh) there a man may commit himſelfe to the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, and rely upon him. For we have heard, that where the meanes faile us, God hath yet in ſtore his foure Prerogatives: therefore when it comes to a dead lift (as we ſay) then to have a ſtrong confidence in God, is thanke-worthy: and it is the practiſe and property of Faith, to ſay boldly with <hi>Abraham,</hi> when he ſaw nothing preſent, that even on the <hi>hill God will provide, Gen.</hi> 22.14. When our enemies are behinde us, and the red Sea before us, then to looke for a way through the Sea, and to expect <hi>Manna</hi> out of heaven, and water out of the Rocke, is much worth. So our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when he and his company were in the Deſert, where no meate was to be had, fed them miraculouſly: but being neare to the Towne where they might have it, he diſmiſſed them. When <hi>Elias</hi> was in diſtreſſe, and all meates failed him, then the Angell brought him meate, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.6. When <hi>Hagar</hi> and <hi>Iſmael</hi> were in the Wilderneſſe, and the water in the bottle ſpent, and ſhe in great heavineſſe, then God comforted her from heaven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.17. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were in the Deſert, then they had an Angell to lead them, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.20. When <hi>Shadrach, Meſhach,</hi> and <hi>Abednego,</hi> were caſt bound into the fiery Furnace, then God ſent them an Angell to be their deliverer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.25. And ſo when <hi>Daniel</hi> was throwne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lyons den, (not when he put himſelfe in) God ſent his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell to ſtop the Lyons mouth, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.22.</p>
                           <p>When we are <hi>deſerti indeſerto,</hi> and all meanes faile, it is time to truſt in God, as <hi>Job</hi> did. Our converſation therefore muſt be without covetouſneſſe, and wee muſt bee content with thoſe things that we have; for he hath ſaid, <hi>He will not faile us, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake us, Heb.</hi> 13.5. This is out of the compaſſe of tempting God, and this is as much as the <hi>Pſalme</hi> could warrant him to looke for. Looke upon it, and you ſhall ſee, that it expreſſeth ſuch dangers, as could not be prevented by mans care and induſtry. As, <hi>from the ſnare of the hunter,</hi> ver. 3. who uſeth to lay it ſo as we cannot ſee it to avoyd it, Verſ. 5. <hi>Thou ſhalt not feare the arrow that flyeth by day.</hi> An Arrow (we know) will reach a man farre off, before he be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware. And ſo throughout the <hi>Pſalme,</hi> they are things out of our defence, therfore they had need of Angels helpe: but when we have meanes to helpe our ſelves, Gods omnipotency is for the time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged. <hi>Eutichus</hi> that fell out of a window by heavineſſe of ſleepe, was reſtored to life by <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20.9. This then is Chriſts anſwer. If there were no ſtaires, and he muſt needs goe downe, it were a good Scripture to meditate on.</p>
                           <p n="3">III. Thirdly, as it is a point of Gods power to helpe without meanes: ſo hath he in his wiſedome appointed meanes: there be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, whereby we aſcend to the effect: they are as a paire of ſtaires. Where theſe are, we muſt uſe them; but when he offereth as a ſtrange ſigne, it is ſcrupulous and fooliſh niceneſſe to refuſe it. As when God
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48000:381"/>bade <hi>Ahaz</hi> aske a ſigne, <hi>Eſay</hi> 7.21. and he would not for tempting God, he was too preciſe, he was but an Hypocrite. <hi>Moſes</hi> asked a ſigne and had it, and God was well pleaſed with it. And ſo did <hi>Gedeon</hi> alſo, to aſſure himſelfe of delivering <hi>Iſrael</hi> by him, <hi>Judg.</hi> 6.36. In great, weighty, and extraordinary callings, it was allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to requeſt a ſigne: but, when there is no need, or when there be otherwiſe ſufficient, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.1. where many miracles were daily done before their eyes, and where (though they had never ſo many more) yet they would not have beleeved on him. Such were the Scribes and Phariſees, that for every trifling occaſion, they much have a ſigne from Heaven. Thus to grate upon Gods omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent providence, is ſawcy malepertneſſe. For ordinary matters, there be ordinary meanes to ſerve our turnes: and for extraordinary, there be extraordinary wayes and meanes reſerved, that we neede not let fall our truſt in matters corporall. We all confeſſe there be meanes, as they which <hi>will not worke, may not eate,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.10. In warfare there is no victory to be hoped for, without fight, building of rampiers, and making of darts and ſhields, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.5. onely in ſpirituall matters we thinke to doe well enough, though we never p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                                 <desc>•••</desc>
                              </gap>oo our endeavour; we lay all upon God, and trouble not our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>There is but one degree or ſtep in all Chriſtianity; it is no more but out of the font to leape ſtraight into Heaven; from <hi>Predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> we leape ſtraight to <hi>Glorification:</hi> it is no matter for <hi>Mortification,</hi> there be no ſuch meane degrees. But Saint <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, it is ſo high, that we had need of a ladder, in which be many ſteps: inſomuch, as he puts a <hi>[How ſhall]</hi> to every ſteppe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on God, on whom they have not beleeved? &amp;c.</hi> There muſt be calling on God, beleeving on him, hearing his word. There muſt be ordinary meanes; and there is a ladder of practiſe, aſwell as of ſpeculation, or contemplation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5, 6. <hi>Joyne vertue with your Faith, and with vertue knowledge, and with knowledge temperance, and ſo patience, godlineſſe, brotherly kindneſſe, and love.</hi> If theſe things be in you, you ſhall not be idle and fruiteleſſe in the knowledge of Chriſt: for he that hath not theſe things, is blinde: he goeth blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to the wood, and may chance hap beſide heaven, or ſteppe beſides the ladder. A great many ſay as <hi>Balaam</hi> did, <hi>O let my Soule dye the death of the Righteous:</hi> but they care not for living the life of the Righteous. He went but blindfold, he knew not the Angell that ſtood with a ſword drawne in the way, but would have gone upon it, if his Aſſe had beene ſo fooliſh. A great many thinke, that preſumption in being ſecure of their ſalvation, is good Divinity. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laam</hi> thought he went well, when he went on the point of a naked ſword. So, one entiſed by the flattery of a harlot, thinkes he goes to a place of great pleaſure: but he goeth, as one that goeth to the ſlaughter, and as a foole to the ſtockes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 7.22. Thoſe whom it pleaſeth God to have partakers of his Kingdome, he puts them in minde <hi>To remember their Creator in the dayes of their youth, before the evill dayes come:</hi> He giveth the grace of timely Repentance, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereth
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48000:382"/>them not to deferre it till the laſt caſt, and then to thinke, that with the turning of a pin (as it were) they ſhall with a trice be in heaven, with <hi>Elias</hi> in a whirle winde. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>We may in ſome caſes adviſe men to have great hope that they ſhall be ſaved, but in no caſe give them warrant of ſecurity.</hi> So, in <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.6. <hi>This wee know, that no whoremonger, nor uncleane perſon, hath any inheritance in the Kingdome of Heaven. Let no man deceive you through vaine words, he that doth righteouſneſſe is righteous, and he that doth unrighteouſneſſe, is of the devill,</hi> Joh. 3.7.</p>
                           <p>Now therefore, to neglect the hearing of the Word, or when he commeth to heare it, to clap downe in his place, without deſire or minde to beare it away, thereby to be bettered in his life; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out purpoſe after by meditating on it, to chew it, and ſo to kindle a fire within himſelfe, whereby it may be digeſted, and turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſubſtance of the minde: this is to tempt God. So alſo, to beare a greater countenance, and make more ſhew of holineſſe, than indeed is in one, is to lay a greater yoke on himſelfe than he need; as <hi>Act.</hi> 15.10. is a tempting of God. Againe, he that ſinneth muſt looke for evill to follow, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 91.10. He therefore that ſinneth, and yet thinketh to eſcape puniſhment, tempteth God. They that by often experience have found, that ſuch and ſuch things, have beene to them occaſions of ſinning, and yet will preſume to uſe the ſame againe, tempts God. And thoſe which ſet up their Idols in their heart, and put the ſtumbling blocke of iniquity before their face, <hi>EZech.</hi> 14.3. and thinke not they ſinne, ſuch tempt God. He that comes to aske forgiveneſſe of God, and will not performe the condition of the Lords Prayer, that is, <hi>Forgive others,</hi> tempts God. Generally, he that ſeeketh for good of God, and will not performe that which he is to doe; or doth evill, thinking to eſcape ſcot-free, without endevouring to avoyd or reſiſt it, both theſe tempt God: and to theſe two, may all other be referred.</p>
                           <p n="4">IV. The fourth is, we muſt not at all tempt God at no hand: we muſt not thinke but God is able to bring water even out of a Rocke, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.11, when there is nothing but rockes, and ſtones; but when we may hope to finde it, we muſt digge for it. So, when the ſoyle will beare Corne, we muſt Till it. When <hi>Eliſha</hi> was in a little village, not able to defend him from the <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> he had cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots and horſes of fire to defend him, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 6.17. but when he was in <hi>Samaria,</hi> (a ſtrong walled City) then when the King of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſent to fetch his head, he ſaid to thoſe which were with him, <hi>Shut the doore,</hi> ver. 32. Chriſt in the Wilderneſſe miraculouſly fed many: in the City he ſent his Diſciples to buy meate, as <hi>John</hi> 4.8. In the beginning, when the Goſpell was publiſhed, there wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſufficient men for the purpoſe: the Apoſtles had the power, as appeareth <hi>Acts</hi> 8.29. that on whomſoever they laid hands, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the holy Ghoſt, and was ſtraight able and meete to Preach the Goſpell: but after, every man to his ſtudy, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Theſe things exerciſe, &amp;c.</hi> We ſee, that notwithſtanding <hi>Paul</hi> was told by
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48000:382"/>an Angell, that there ſhould be no loſſe of any mans life in the ſhip, yet he cauſed the Mariners to cut the ropes, and to caſt Anchor, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.23, 24.29, 30, 31, 32. Nay, when ſome would have gone out by boate, he would not let them: ſo here Chriſt anſwereth, that howſoever Angels attend on him, he may not tempt God.</p>
                           <p n="5">V. Now follow the reaſons why we may not tempt God. There be two ſorts of tempting; the one, by ignorance; the other by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe. It is the manner of Chirurgions, when they are to dreſſe a wound, and know not how farre, nor which way it goeth, to tent it: In the ſame manner is God (after the manner of men) ſaid to tempt us; ſometimes to prove what is in our hearts, and whether we will keepe his Commandements, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.2. as he did the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> forty yeares. To this end, he both <hi>made them hungry,</hi> and <hi>fed them with Manna.</hi> We ſometimes tempt God, as if the arme of his power had received a wound, or his eye a hurt; as if he could not helpe or diſcerne our wants as well as before, becauſe he brings us not water out of the Rocke, <hi>Numb.</hi> 20.10. but ſuch miracles now are not agreeing with his will, which content us. <hi>He will have mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on whom he will have mercy, Rom.</hi> 9.19. And we muſt not <hi>deſpiſe the riches of his bounteouſneſſe, and patience, and long-ſuffering, which leadeth to Repentance, Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>The Lords hand is not ſhortned, that he cannot ſave; nor his eare heavy, that it cannot heare:</hi> becauſe he doth not reprove us, <hi>we thinke him like us, Pſal.</hi> 50.19. When God holds his peace, we thinke his tongue is cut: <hi>But I will not alwayes hold my peace,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>Mal. ult.</hi> But how ſhall I know this, ſay men now adayes? as <hi>Zacharias</hi> knew his wife was with childe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.18. who (when he would not beleeve the Angell that told him ſo, but would needes have a ſigne,) was ſtricken dumbe. <hi>Behold thou ſhalt be dumbe till the day.</hi> Here is a ſigne for incredulity: he had beene as good have beleeved without a ſigne.</p>
                           <p>The ſecond kinde of tempting, proceedeth of over-much famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity, when as we thinke we may be bold with God, and that he will take it in good part, and therefore we will put him to it, (as we ſay:) we will try both him and his Angels, what mettle is in them and what they can doe. We are to thinke upon the name of God, as of a heavy and weighty thing, that is, not upon every ſmall oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to be taken up and removed. We are not to accompt it as a feather, that we may lightly toſſe up and downe at our pleaſure; and even ſo are we to eſteeme of the mercy of God. It is not to be advocated upon every vaine trifle, for that were to uſe God as we are wont to uſe our Juglers. Come on, let us ſee what you can doe, ſhew us a miracle, ſay they, <hi>Exod.</hi> 7.11. So <hi>Herod</hi> deſired to <hi>ſee Chriſt,</hi> that he might ſee ſome miracle of him, as in <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.8. It is a heavy caſe when men ſtand thus affected toward God: when afterwards, in <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.64. they <hi>blind-folded him, and bade him read who ſtrucke him.</hi> We our ſelves would not be ſo uſed, we could not endure to ſee our friends uſed ſo: how much leſſe ought we to uſe God in that manner? eſpecially, that attribute, quality, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48000:383"/>of God, which of all others, he would have to be moſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyed, that is, his mercy? He muſt needs take it very hainouſly to ſee that abuſed, ſince (of all the reſt) be makes moſt accompt of it. Howſoever he could be content to ſerve, yet would he not be a ſervant to our ſinnes in any caſe, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.24. eſpecially not to be made a packe-horſe (if I may ſo ſay) for our ſinnes, to lay load on, even till his backe ake. He ſaith, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13, that <hi>hee is preſt under us, as a cart is preſt that is under ſheaves.</hi> Let us not make a dung-cart of Gods mercy, let us forbeare him that ſervice of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                           <p n="6">VI. The ſixt is, that none of theſe <hi>Dominum Deum tuum,</hi> neither <hi>Lord,</hi> nor <hi>God,</hi> nor that he is thine, are fit arguments to prove, that we may preſume upon him. The devill belike had perceived, that there was ſome acquaintance betweene Chriſt and God, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure had ſaid unto him; You may be bold with him, and with his Angels. What? he is your Father, and (as <hi>Caeſars</hi> daughter anſwered) that though he forget himſelfe to be <hi>Caeſar,</hi> yet doe not you forget to be his Sonne. No ſaith Chriſt, theſe be no good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to make one preſume. As for <hi>Dominus</hi> we will all grant (I am ſure) there is ſmall matter of preſumption in that. In <hi>Deus</hi> there may be ſome more colour: but yet very little. It is no good dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with one that is mightier than our ſelves, leſt he happen not to take it in good part, but fall to earneſt, and ſo we feele the ſmart. We were not beſt to make ſport with <hi>Sampſon,</hi> leaſt he pull the houſe about our eares, and ſo make us pay dearely for our paſtime. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Doe we provoke the Lord to anger? Are we ſtronger than he?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.22. If we will needs tempt, we were beſt tempt with our matches. There is no dealing with fire, for it will burne all that toucheth it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.7. his Angels and Miniſters are a flame of fire: but <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.29. it is ſaid, <hi>Our God is even a conſuming fire.</hi> Indeed, if he were like <hi>Dagon</hi> the <hi>Philiſtims</hi> god, he might be ſet up and taken downe, and we might breake his necke and hands at our pleaſure: but being the ſtrong and mighty God of Hoaſts, we were beſt take heed how we deale with him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>Tuum,</hi> what ſay we to that? An ungracious child might make that an argument of preſumption, but whoſoever is of a good nature, will make it an argument of the contrary. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was <hi>Jacobs</hi> father, but was <hi>Jacob</hi> more bold to abuſe him for that? No, but rather more timerous, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27. <hi>My father</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>may chance feele me; and ſo I ſhall ſeeme to him a mocker, and ſo bring a curſe on me, and not a bleſsing.</hi> Is God mercifull? yea truly, <hi>Mercy is with thee,</hi> but <hi>that thou mayeſt be feared, Pſal.</hi> 130.4. We may not abuſe his mercy, as <hi>to ſinne that grace may abound, Rom.</hi> 6.1. Is he bountifull and long ſuffering? We muſt therefore the more feare to diſpleaſe him. When the Phariſees tempted him, and would adventure their ſoules in ſeeking a ſigne, it is ſaid, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.11. <hi>Chriſt ſighed:</hi> and why did he ſigh? Becauſe God <hi>ſware in his wrath, that they ſhould never enter into his reſt, whoſe Fathers tempted him in the Wilderneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 95. What reſt? He doth not
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48000:383"/>meane the reſt in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> onely, but that which ſhall be in the Kingdome of God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.10. Theſe two temptations of the devil, may fitly be compared to thoſe two rockes, betweene which <hi>Jonathan</hi> was to paſſe, which are ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.4. to be ſharpe. One is called <hi>Bozez,</hi> which ſignifyeth dirt; the other <hi>Seneh,</hi> which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifyeth a Bramble, or ſome ſharpe pricke; betweene which, he and his Armor-bearer were faine to clamber up, <hi>ver.</hi> 13. Betweene two ſuch Rockes lyeth our way, that is, <hi>Preſumption,</hi> and <hi>Deſperation:</hi> therefore bleſſed is he that ſo loveth God, that he can be content to creepe on hands and feete to him.</p>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T the firſt overthrow, we had the firſt <hi>Againe:</hi> and when Chriſt overthrew him then alſo, yet would not the devill leave then neither, but he commeth with his ſecond <hi>Againe:</hi> he comes <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,</hi> and <hi>Againe.</hi> The firſt <hi>Againe,</hi> was an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of his courage and ſtomacke: this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, is an argument of his importunity. The firſt repulſe could not drive him away, nor the ſecond neither; no, nor this third for altogether: for <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, <hi>He departed for a ſeaſon, Luk.</hi> 4.13. So that as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 16.16. <hi>After a while ye ſhall ſee me, and after a while you ſhall not ſee me:</hi> ſo ſaith the devill alſo, <hi>After a while you ſhall not ſee me, and againe, after a while you ſhall ſee me.</hi> Which teacheth us this leſſon; that it is not enough to have prevailed againſt his temptations twice or thrice, and ſo become ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure; but we are alway to ſtand upon our guard, knowing how the devill will ſucceſſively, every turning of a hand, be with us; and that while we live, we ſhall never be at reſt with him: or if he tempt us not, we ſhall be in as bad or worſe caſe. For ſo long as the Lord left other Nations among the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to prove them by, and to be prickes to their ſides, it went well enough with them, <hi>Judg.</hi> 3.1. but when they began to live in ſome ſecurity (having for the moſt part ſubdued them) then grew they to mutuall diſſention. It is the greateſt temptation to be without temptation. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> had the meſſenger of Satan to buffet him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7. for then followes the preſſing of God by prayers. But whether we joyne hands with Satan, or reſiſt him, we ſhall be ſure he will ſet upon us, and try by faire meanes what he can doe; or if we ſay nay, yet in the end he will weary us, as <hi>Dalila</hi> did <hi>Sampſon, Judg.</hi> 16.16. who becauſe ſhe was importunate, his ſoule was pained to the death, and then he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48000:384"/>told her: or if we will be obſtinate in rejecting his temptations, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him at the firſt a peremptory refuſall; then he will goe another way to worke, as to imagine ſome deviſe againſt us, and ſmite us with the tongue, <hi>Jer.</hi> 18.18. he will be rough with us. If none of theſe will prevaile, he will perſwade us, we muſt be like other men, and that is as profitable or pleaſant to us, and then ſay <hi>Samuel</hi> what he can, we will have a King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.19. And when we have yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded once, then goes he to fetch company, and takes unto him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven worſe ſpirits than himſelfe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.26. So the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe than the firſt. Give but an inch, and he will take an Ell: if he can get in but an arme, he will make ſhift to ſhove in his whole body. As we ſee, if the point of a nayle have once made en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the reſt will ſoone in. We ſee an example of his encroaching even in <hi>David,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.4. after he had once made him commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery by ſome meane degrees with <hi>Bathſheba,</hi> ſee how he drawes him on from one wickedneſſe to another. She was with child, her husband being in the ſervice of God and the King, was by the King murthered to hide her ſhame, and ſatisfie his luſt. So did he draw on <hi>Peter;</hi> firſt, he made him follow a loofe off; ſecondly, flatly to deny Chriſt; thirdly, to forſweare him; and fourthly, to curſe himſelfe if he knew him.</p>
                           <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> writers note, that the Devils name <hi>Belzebub,</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a great fleſh Fly, or a maſter Fly; flap him away never ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, he will ſtill flye thither againe. So the devill will never ceaſe moleſting us, till the ſmoking flax be quite quenched, and the brui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed reed cleane broken, <hi>Eſay</hi> 42.3. Firſt, he twiſts certaine ſmall threds together, and ſo makes a little cord of vanity, to draw us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him: afterward with a cart-rope or cable of iniquity, he ſeekes to binde us faſt unto him for ſtarting; either by the vice of luſt, or of envy, or at leaſt covetouſneſſe. But if all ſhould faile, pride is ſure to hold; <hi>O Lord, I thanke thee, I am not like ſuch and ſuch, nor like this Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can,</hi> (a degree farther,) <hi>nor like this Phariſee, Luke</hi> 18.11. This may be a good caveat unto us, that we ſtand alway upon our guard, and that we be ſure that we make ſtrong reſiſtance in the beginning, and breake it (if we can) while it is but a whip-cord. And to uſe the like policy in a good matter, that the King of <hi>Egypt</hi> did in a bad; who tooke order that every male childe ſhould be killed, to keepe the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> downe betimes: and againſt the ſucceſſion of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to entertaine the ſucceſſion of Prayer.</p>
                           <p>Now to the matter. The Devill deales a with a City. In the firſt, he tels him he muſt be famiſhed, except he can turne ſtones into bread. Secondly, he comes to make a traine of Scripture to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap him. Now he comes to the ordinary meanes of dealing, that is; when men ſtrive about any thing, and both parties are loath to yeeld, there will be ſome parley of compoſition and ſharing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene them. So here, the devill ſeeing that he cannot overthrow his faith, offereth him to compound: and (on his part) he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to give Chriſt all the Kingdomes of the world, if our Saviour (for his part) will but fall downe, and worſhip him. The devill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48000:385"/>came diſguiſed in the ſhape of a male-content, as that Chriſt ſhould be in ſuch hunger. Next, he came in the habit of a Divine, and that very demurely, with his Pſalter in his hand. Now he comes in all his Royalty, like the Prince of this world, as he is ſo called, <hi>John</hi> 4.30. He doth not ſtand pedling with Chriſt, but goes round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frankely to worke: he offers all that he hath, (and that is no ſmall matter) to bring Chriſt but to one ſinne, that ſo he might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow all mankinde. He comes no more now with <hi>Si filius Dei es:</hi> for that we ſee is here left, he would not have him thinke on it: he would have him now, <hi>filius ſeculi.</hi> This is called by Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> the bewitching temptation, whereby men become ſo fooliſh, as that after they have begun in the Spirit, they will end in the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.3. Where the devill cannot prevaile, either by our owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcence, or by his enticings, he will ſee what he can doe with his Dragons taile, and by that meanes (ſay the Fathers) he did more hurt, than by the other. Secondly, his tayle is ſaid to draw downe <hi>the third part of the ſtarres of heaven, and to caſt them to the earth, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poc.</hi> 12.4.</p>

So in adverſity we vow to God, that we will ſerve him; but after helpe, we breake it.</item>
                              <item>II. Secondly, the liſts where this temptation was uſed, was the <hi>Mountaine.</hi> The reaſon why he choſe this place rather than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is the fitneſſe of it, in regard of the proſpect. The wilderneſſe (we know) was a melancholy place, and in no wiſe fit for this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptation, ſo, neither was the Pinacle: for beſides that it might have hindred the working of this temptation, being the Pinacle of the Temple; the proſpect was not good enough. For though it were high, yet there were divers hils about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which would have hindred the ſight of many things. And though <hi>Sion</hi> were a Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, yet in reſpect of Mount <hi>Hermon,</hi> and <hi>Libanus,</hi> it is ſaid to be a little one, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.6. And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.16. <hi>Baſan</hi> is ſaid to be the great Hill. Therefore as God choſe a convenient Hill, both for heighth and neemeſſe, where <hi>Moſes</hi> might behold the whole Land of <hi>Canaan, Deut.</hi> 32.49. So here the devill choſe an exceeding high Mountaine,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48000:385"/>where a high minde might beſt take view and comtemplate: ſuch, where his horizon might be as ſpacious as was poſſible, and where his ſight might not be hindred by any meane object.</item>
                              <item>III. Thirdly, he ſets before his eyes, <hi>all the kingdomes of the earth.</hi> There is nothing ſo ſoone enticed and led away, as the eye: it is the Broker betweene the heart, and all wicked luſts that be in the world. And therefore it was great folly in <hi>Hezechias,</hi> to ſhew his robes and treaſure, <hi>Eſay</hi> 39.2. as he was told by the Prophet: it ſtirred up ſuch coales of deſire in them that ſaw them, as could not be quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, till they had fetcht away all that he had, and all that his Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors had laid up, even till that day. It is the wiſdome that is uſed now adayes, when men would have one thing for another, to ſhew the thing they would ſo exchange: as the buyer ſheweth his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the ſeller his wares in the beſt manner that he can, each to entice the other (by the eye) to the deſire of the heart. It is the devils ancient ſleight, he would not goe about to perſwade the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in words, till he might withall preſent the thing to the eye. So he dealt with <hi>Eve, Gen.</hi> 3.6. Firſt he ſhewed her how pleaſant the fruite was, and the woman ſaw it. So the cauſe of the deluge was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.2. that <hi>the Sonnes of God ſaw the beauty of the Daughters of men. Achabs</hi> ſeeing of <hi>Naboths</hi> vineyard, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 21.2. for that it lay neere his houſe, was the cauſe of all the miſchiefe that followed. This ſame fooliſh vanity of apparell, (whereof I have given ſo often war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning out of this place,) comes from hence: <hi>I ſaw a fine Babiloniſh gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſiring it, I tooke it,</hi> ſaith <hi>Achan, Joſhu.</hi> 7.11. So the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the bribe, <hi>blindeth the eyes of the Judge, Deut.</hi> 16.19. So ſtill the ſight of the eye, allureth the heart to deſire. The Heathen man therefore wiſhed, that vertue and honeſty might as well be ſeene with bodily eyes: for then he thinketh, that <hi>Admirabiles amores ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citarent ſuo.</hi> So if we could as well ſee that which God hath for us as that the devill here offereth us: we would not regard the devils largeſſe. <hi>Moſes</hi> and the other Patriarchs ſaw him which is inviſible, which had provided a better thing for them: <hi>Therefore he refuſed to be called the ſonne of Pharaohs daughter, Heb.</hi> 11.27. <hi>And to enjoy the pleaſure of ſinne.</hi> But you are not ſo to take it, as though it were a thing ſimply ill to behold ſuch things, or to looke on a cup-boord of plate, or to ſtand on a Pinacle, it is dangerous, but no ſinne; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially; it is unfit for an unſtayed, and an ungoverned eye. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Lot</hi> and his wife were forbidden to looke backe at the deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sodome, Gen.</hi> 19.17. To <hi>Abraham</hi> it was left at large, without any reſtraint; for that he was a man of better ruled affections. For, as there muſt be one without, to take view and to entice: ſo muſt there be one within, to hearken to it, and to condiſcend. Be ſure of that within, that it be upright; and then thou mayeſt the better looke with that which is without. But ever be wary, for the tinder of thy nature will ſoone take fire. <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, Chap. 31.1. <hi>He made a covenant with his eyes: why then ſhould he thinke on a maid? and that he had not beene deceyved by a woman,</hi> verſ. 9. <hi>and that his heart had not walked after his eyes,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>Paul knew how to uſe want, and how to uſe
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48000:386"/>abundance or plenty, how poverty: both to be full, and to be hungry:</hi> he had ſtayed affections, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.12.</item>
                              <item>IV. <hi>Omnia Regna.</hi> This was no ſmall offer, but even all the wealth and honour that may be: two ſuch things as are moſt vehemently deſired of all men. So that as <hi>Jerome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Prae auri ſacra fame ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil ſacrum.</hi> The deſire thereof alſo is ſo unſatiable, that it is like the dropſie; which, the more liquor is miniſtred to it, the more it thirſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; it is perpetuall and unnaturall. The leſſe time a man hath to live, and ſo needes the leſſe; the more he covets to abound. Theſe two doe never waxe old; of all vices, gray haires doe never grow on theſe. This is the baite the devill laid for Chriſt, and layes for youth, and mindes laſciviouſly given, he layes a baite on live fleſh; to cholericke natures, he miniſtreth matters that may encreaſe their wrath; for melancholy, he laies baites of envy: and ſo for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one, according to their naturall inclinations and humours, ſuch baites as may entice them ſooneſt. Which if he can get them once to ſwallow his hooke that is within, it will hold them ſure enough, and by his line he will draw them to him when he liſt; ſo that he cares not to let them play with the line: then, though hee goe to twenty Sermons; it is no matter: with an Apple he caught <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and all their poſterity. Well, we muſt be as children, wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from this world, though it bring weeping with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131.2. <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.38. When <hi>Eve</hi> was Lady and Miſtreſſe of all the world; yet becauſe there was a Godſhip, a higher degree than hers, ſhe was not content. Princes, becauſe they can goe no higher by any earthly dignity, aſpire to be gods, and ſo would be accounted; as was ſaid to <hi>Herod,</hi> that it was the voyce of God, and not of Man. But, as they that are above, can abide to have no equals, but will be alone by themſelves; ſo they that be below, can abide no ſuperiours. As when <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen by lot from amongſt the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to be King over them, ſome wicked men ſaid, <hi>There is a goodly wiſe King: nay, I would I were King, I would they might come to me for Juſtice,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.4. Every one hath this conceit of himſelfe, that he is worthier to beare rule, than they which are in authority: not ſo much as the ſilly Fur-buſh, but it thought it ſelfe a fit perſon to make a King, <hi>Judg.</hi> 9.15. and the Thiſtle would have the Cedars daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter marryed to his ſonne, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.9. The Spider, a ſilly poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full thing, will yet be in the top of the Kings Palaces, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.28. The Gourd ſtarts up in one night, and was gone in the next, <hi>Jon.</hi> 4.6. Goodly <hi>Zebedeus</hi> wife, could finde no leſſe thing to aske of Chriſt, for her two ſonnes, that came the laſt day from the cart, but that the one might ſit at Chriſts right hand, and the other at the left in his Kingdome, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20.20. <hi>Balaam</hi> could never thinke his Aſſe went halfe faſt enough, when he rode towards preferment, <hi>Num.</hi> 22.17. The Diſciples alſo longed for the Kingdome of <hi>Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> to be reſtored.</item>

                           <p>The devill did not ſhew all his Kingdome to <hi>Saul,</hi> when he was comming from keeping his Fathers ſheepe, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9.24. and <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> feaſted him: nor after <hi>Saul</hi> was choſen King, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.5. <hi>and he
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48000:386"/>followed his cattell:</hi> neither did he ſhew them to the King, bidden to <hi>Abſalons</hi> ſheep-ſhearing, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 13.24. nor at ſuch time as Princes withdraw themſelves to be private, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6.18. But he ſhewes them at ſuch times as they are in their greateſt glory and ruffe, when king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes were growne to the top of jollity and Majeſty, as the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was in <hi>Solomons</hi> time: and chooſeth ſuch a time, as when they were in moſt triumph and pompe, as they were wont to be at the day of the Kings birth, or inauguration, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 7.5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.11. or at a Coronation, or at the receiving of Ambaſſadors; or at the entertaining of forraigne States, as when the Queene of <hi>Saba</hi> was in <hi>Solomons</hi> Court, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 10. To conclude, he ſhewed them not when they are in a baſe eſtate, but when they are in greateſt pompe. <hi>Act.</hi> 25.23.</p>
                           <p>Now come we to the ſecond point: to wit, the Temptation it ſelfe: <hi>En haec omnia tibi dabo, ver.</hi> 9. Having prepared Chriſts minde (as he thought) by ſhewing him that he would give him: now he comes in with a ſhort and pithy Oration; <hi>[All this will I give thee.]</hi> Here thou ſeeſt all thou canſt wiſh for; without thee ſhall no man lift up his hand or his foote in all <hi>Egipt,</hi> as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſaid to <hi>Joſeph, Gen.</hi> 41.44. ſo as he might make all Captaines, and give to every one fields and vineyards, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.7. that he might ſay to every one what he liſt; <hi>Speakeſt thou to me? Seeſt thou not that I have power to crucifie thee, or to let thee goe? John</hi> 19.10. that his favour might raiſe a man ſo high, as <hi>Haman</hi> was exalted above all the Princes, <hi>Heſt.</hi> 3.1. and his disfavour, or the leaſt word of his mouth quite overthrow him, as <hi>Haman</hi> was, <hi>verſe</hi> 7.8. by picking ſome ſmall quarrell againſt him. But this is not all neither: for the ſame gayiſh apparell, wherein ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny doe delight, is contained under this <hi>Haec omnia:</hi> Not onely em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broydered with gold, but even gold it ſelfe, and ſmels of the fineſt ſcent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.8, 9. And as for the delights of the fleſh, if he can ſee any that delight him better than other: it is no more than with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 11.4. to ſend for her and have her, ſhe was ſtraight at his command. Neither muſt any ſay, it was unlawfull: no, not <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> if he love his head, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.17. He may command what he liſt; if any gaineſay it, he may diſpatch him out of the way: for he may kill and wound whom he liſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.19. He may command all mens tongues, 2 <hi>Samuel</hi> 14.10. that they dare not once open their mouth to ſpeake againſt him. Nay, hee ſhall have all mens tongues and pens, ready to extoll all that he doth, and ſay; <hi>The King is like an Angel of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 19. or that <hi>it is the voyce of God, and not of man, Act.</hi> 12.22. Why, then to have all mens hands, feet, bodies, faces, tongues, and pens: this may be well ſaid <hi>All,</hi> to have not onely one Kingdome, but all: to have all the power and glory of thoſe Kingdomes: here is even all the kingdome, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the glory. He comes not after a pelting manner, he ſhewes himſelfe a franke chapman: he ſaith not, that <hi>Godlineſſe is great gaine, and a minde content with his lot,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. and wils him to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with <hi>food and rayment, ver.</hi> 8. He comes not with <hi>Illa,</hi> which we
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48000:387"/>ſhall not once behold till another world come; and whether there be any ſuch or no, many doubt. He ſhewes him a mount that may be touched, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.18. he comes with <hi>haec,</hi> that is, with ready mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in his hand: he not onely offers, but ſtakes downe: and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as God ſaith, that in the <hi>ſweat of our fore-head we ſhall eate our bread, Gen.</hi> 3.19. the devill requires no ſuch thing. This is a donative, <hi>Haec amnia dabo.</hi> What ſay ye now? Shall Chriſt take it, or no?</p>
                           <p>The Heathen man ſaith, if a man be to violate his faith for any thing, it is for a Kingdome: Chriſt hath here offered him all King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, a very enticing baite: but is there never a hooke hidden un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it? The woman was fine and brave, and had a cup of gold in her hand, but it was full of abomination, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 17.14. So here, for all theſe faire ſhewes, if you will gaine any thing by the devill, you muſt worſhip him; that is the condition annexed to the grant, it is no abſolute gift, the devill is not ſo kind, as to part from all that for nothing. It is ſuch a gift as the Lawyers call <hi>Excambium,</hi> that is, Exchange: I will give you this, if you will give me that. But yet one would thinke it a very large offer, to give ſo great a lieu for ſo ſmall a ſervice; it is but a little externall reverence, the bowing of the knee; you may (notwithſtanding) in heart thinke what ye liſt. Well, we may thinke there was ſomewhat in it, that the devill offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo much for ſo little, and yet Chriſt refuſed it. Indeed Chriſt had great reaſon to refuſe it: for he ſhould have beene a loſer by the bargaine. I will ſtand to it, he had beene better to have yeelded to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two former temptations, than to this: he ſhould full deere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have bought all his kingdomes, he had beene better to have caſt himſelfe downe from the Pinacle. For that which the devill here demandeth in lieu, is as much worth, as both the glory of God, and the redemption of man. Of his glory, God ſaith, <hi>That hee will not give it to another, Eſay</hi> 42.8. If to no other, then not to the devill of all other. And therefore the Angell would not have a burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering offered to him, but to God, <hi>Judg.</hi> 13.16. The Angell would not let <hi>John</hi> fall downe and worſhip him, but bad him worſhip God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.10. For he knew that God was very jealous of his honour, and ſtood preciſely upon that point. If he would not impart this honour with the Angels, much leſſe would he with the devill: for there are degrees in idolatry, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.23. It is not ſo ill to turne the glory of God into the image of a man, as into birds and beaſts.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, if we looke into the deſire that he had to ſatisfie his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient envy, by the deſtruction of mankind: we muſt needs commend the devils wit, in making ſuch a bargaine. It had beene the beſt pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny worth that ever was bought. For if we marke how Chriſt rateth one onely ſoule, we may ſee, how he, that to gaine all the kingdomes of the world, ſhall loſe his owne ſoule, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.26. makes but a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh bargaine; Then what rate ſhall be made of all mens ſoules, if one be worth kingdomes; all which had beene loſt, if Chriſt had conſented to that which the devill here requireth: for then he could not have ſaid, <hi>I reſtored that which I tooke not, Pſal.</hi> 69.4. By his death he payed the price for the ſinnes of the whole world; he ſhould then
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48000:387"/>have had a ſcore of his owne to have paid, and his death could have beene ſufficient but for himſelfe onely. If he had falne downe, and worſhipped him, he could not have ſaid, <hi>That the Prince of this world had nothing to ſay againſt him, John</hi> 14.3.</p>
                           <p>Now let us apply this to our ſelves.</p>
                           <p>But we will peradventure ſay, the devill never made us any ſuch offer; and therefore what needs any admoniſhment in this behalfe? But I anſwer, though the devill come not in perſon to us, as he did to Chriſt, yet he comes by his inſtruments. When <hi>Balak</hi> ſent to <hi>Balaam,</hi> to come and curſe the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and promiſed him great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.17. it was not <hi>Balaks</hi> meſſengers that ſpake, but the devill uſed them as inſtruments to ſpeake. So when <hi>Simon Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus</hi> would have bought the Holy Ghoſt with money; the devill therein tempted the Apoſtles with Simonie, <hi>Simon</hi> was but the trunke, through which the devill ſpake, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.</p>
                           <p>Againe, there be ſome that will ſay; they were never tempted with Kingdomes: It may well be, for it needs not, when leſſe will ſerve. It was Chriſt onely, that was thus tempted: in him lay a Heroicall mind, that could not be allured with ſmall matters. But with us it is nothing ſo; we eſteeme farre more baſely of our ſelves: wee ſet our wares at a very eaſie price, he may buy us even dagger-cheape, as we ſay: he need never carry us ſo high as the Mount, the Pina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is high enough; yea, the loweſt ſteeple in all the Towne would ſerve the turne. Or let him but carry us to the Leads or gutters of our owne houſes, nay, let us but ſtand in our window, or in our doores; if he will give us but ſo much as we can there ſee, he will tempt us throughly, we will accept it, and thanke him too. He ſhall not need to come to us with Kingdomes, one Kingdome is too much, what ſay ye to halfe a one? <hi>Mark.</hi> 6.23. No, will the devill ſay, I will give ye halfe a one? If he would come to us but with thirty pence, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.15. I am afraid many of us would play <hi>Judas.</hi> Nay, leſſe than ſo would buy a great ſort, even handfuls of Barley, and peeces of Bread, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.19. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.21. Yea, ſome will not ſticke to buy and ſell the poore for a paire of ſhooes, as <hi>Amos</hi> ſpeaketh, Chap. 8.6.</p>
                           <p>When he commeth then to tempt us, he may abate a great deale of this that he offers Chriſt; he may ſtrike out <hi>Omnia</hi> and <hi>Hac</hi> too, and inſtread thereof of put in <hi>Hoc,</hi> and ſay; Hold, ye ſhall have this to worſhip me, I will give ye no more; I feare me we will make ſhort worke, and take it, <hi>Hoc aliquid,</hi> a matter of halfe a crowne or ten groates, a paire of ſhooes, or ſome ſuch trifle, will bring us on our knees to the devill. Is there a pretty commodity to be had? It makes no matter for breaking faith and promiſe. This is that that makes the devill ſo good a husband and thrifty, and to goe neere hand: what need he give more, when ſo little will ſerve? Whereas, if we will ſtand hucking with him, we might get a great deale more.</p>
                           <p>In this temptation (as in the former) there is both fire to conſume
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48000:388"/>our faith, and a dart to wound our conſciences. The fire is the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcontent, that God is either a poore God, not able ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to reward thoſe that ſerve him: or elſe an unkind God, that will not reward the duties that are performed by thoſe that ſerve him. By this we come to ſay: <hi>Who is the Almighty, that we ſhould ſerve him? Job</hi> 21.15. The wicked are they that proſper and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in riches. <hi>I have cleanſed my heart in vaine, for daily have I beene puniſhed, Pſal.</hi> 73.12. Then this dart makes us weary of well doing; and then followes, that we will ſerve the devill. Being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content with Gods ſervice, we undertake the ſervice of his enemy: he requireth nothing but a little falling downe, and then if <hi>Simon</hi> ſhall come, and require any unlawfull thing at our hands, we are ready (with <hi>Judas</hi>) to meete with him, and ſay; <hi>What will ye give me, and I will doe it? Matth.</hi> 26.15. though it be to the betraying of Chriſt. The devill here opens his meaning in this Temptation plainely, <hi>(that he would have him fall downe and worſhip him)</hi> with a bare and bold face: before, he came diſguiſed, and ſpake in Parables. His mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is not when he ſaith <hi>Dabo,</hi> to give them; but to barter or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change one thing for another. It is no gift, but a flat bargaine: men uſe not to account it a gift, except it be without rendring backe ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther money or ſervice. If he render here ſervice backe, he may well thinke I have ſold my ſoule for <hi>Hoc aliquid, Matth.</hi> 16.76. He may thinke, as <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birth-right for a meſſe of pottage, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.16. ſo hath he ſold his ſoule, his birth-right, and freedome: for we were all bought with a price, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.23. the ſame great high Prieſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed us all with his blood. No ſinnes are ſo carefully to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken heed of, as theſe, that have annexed to adoration, donation: he hath <hi>Malum</hi> with a joynter. If he ſhould have caſt himſelfe downe from the Pinacle, here is all he ſhould have had: they would have talkt of it, and have wondred a while at it.</p>
                           <p>Well, we muſt be thus perſwaded, that God is as well able and willing to reward us for any ſervice, as the devill, and better too. It is he indeed that reigneth over the kingdomes of men, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.21. and placeth in them whom pleaſeth him: but when he giveth or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, he giveth indeed freely, exacting nothing backe againe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe it be ſuch things, as he were to have without any ſuch gift: ſuch things as are due of meere right, without any ſtipulation or hire, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. The devils <hi>Dabo,</hi> is, as Offices and Parſonages are given amongſt us; that is, as uſually ſold as horſes in <hi>Smithfield.</hi> But if we could be content to give indeed, let that heroicall minde that was in <hi>Abraham</hi> be in us, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.23. that as he would not take any thing of <hi>Melchiſedech,</hi> ſo we will not be a ſhoo-lachet the richer by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill. If he offer to make us wealthy, let us anſwer him; <hi>Pecunia tua tecum pereat.</hi>

                              <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He anſwering of this Temptation, if ſome had had the anſwering of it, would have beene <hi>facto,</hi> by the doing of the thing that the devill required: and not in words, ſtanding upon termes in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. Inſomuch, as they would never have cared for a cuſhion to kneele on; but have fallen down ſtraight on their very faces, and have thanked him too. If <hi>Balaak</hi> ſhould ſay unto one of them, <hi>I will promote thee to great honor, Numb.</hi> 22.17. an Angel ſtanding in the way, ſhould not hinder him from going. The manner of fleſh and blood is, in caſes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment, to reſpect nothing that may bring them out of their concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved hope or deſire thereof: and therefore, whatſoever it is that ſtands in their way, be it never ſo holy, downe it ſhall for haſte, to make the way neareſt. In regard of this, one brother reſpects not another. When <hi>Joſeph</hi> had had a dreame of his brethren, and told it them, all brotherly affection was laid aſide, <hi>Gen.</hi> 37.5. The ſonne and ſubject <hi>Abſolon,</hi> forgetteth his duty as to his father, and allegeance as to his Prince, ſeeking his life, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.11. The mother of <hi>Ahaziah, Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia,</hi> when ſhe ſaw her ſonne dead, makes no more adoe, but deſtroyes all the Kings ſeed, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 11.1. <hi>Jehu</hi> makes no bones, nor is abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſight of heapes of dead mens heads, of Kings ſonnes that he had cauſed to be ſlaine, but addes more murthers to them, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 10.8. What's a basketfull of heads to a Kingdome? And <hi>Herod</hi> ſtacke not to kill all the male-borne children in <hi>Bethlem, Matth.</hi> 2.16. So that <hi>Gregory</hi> might well ſay, <hi>Ambitio eſt vita, cui etiam innocentes nocent,</hi> ſuch is the vehement deſire of a Kingdome. So that a great many would have made no ſcruple at the matter, neither would they have counted it a temptation, but good counſell: Neither would ſo have cut up <hi>Peter</hi> as Chriſt did, to bid him goe behinde him, and turne their backes on him; but they would rather have turn'd their
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48000:389"/>backes to God, and their faces after Satan, <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.27. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.15. And indeed it muſt needs be, that either our Saviour was unwiſe in refuſing ſo good an offer, or elſe the World (in theſe dayes) is in a wrong byas.</p>
                           <p>Our Saviour (we ſee) doth not onely refuſe the thing, but alſo gives him hard words, for making the offer and motion. For he doth not onely confute him here, by ſaying, <hi>Scriptum eſt:</hi> but he addes words of bitter reprehenſion, ſaying, <hi>Avoid Satan.</hi> He might have given faire words, as he did before: but here he ſeemeth to have left his patience. The reaſon why he was more hot in this, than in the former, is, for that this toucheth the glory of God, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of mankinde: the former Temptations touched but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in particular, as the turning of ſtones into bread, but for mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle: and the caſting himſelfe downe, was but to try God, what care he had of him. But this ſo much toucheth the glory of God, as he can hold no longer. Alſo, his longing to redeeme man, cauſed the ſame. Neither did he onely anſwer the devill ſo; but when his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle, who meant friendly to him, moved him to the like mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he rebuked him ſharpely.</p>
                           <p>Two cauſes there are, wherein Chriſt is very earneſt; one in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell miniſtred to him, tending to the impairing of Gods glory; the other in practiſes, tending to the impairing of Gods Church, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. there he was not onely vehement in words; but made a whip to ſcourge them out. And ſo in the Old Teſtament, it is ſaid of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Numb.</hi> 12.3. <hi>That he was a meeke man, above all the men of the earth;</hi> yet when he came to a caſe of Idolatry, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.19. it is ſaid, <hi>Hee threw the Tables out of his hands, and brake them.</hi> And ſo farre did he loſe his naturall affection to his people and Countrymen, that he cauſed a great number of them to be ſlaine. And ſo in a caſe of the Church, when <hi>Corah</hi> rebelled, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.15. then <hi>Moſes</hi> waxed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry angry; for <hi>Glory be to God on high, and peace on earth,</hi> is the Angels ſong and joy, and the devils griefe: as on the other ſide, the diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God, and diſſention of the Church, is the devils joy, and griefe of the Angels.</p>
                           <p>Now, beſides that he doth in words rebuke him ſharpely, he doth no leſſe in geſture alſo; as by turning his backe upon him, (as it is moſt like he did, in ſaying, <hi>Avoid Satan</hi>) which is ſuch a deſpitefull diſgrace, as if that one ſhould offer us the like, we would take it in very great diſdaine. Which is to us an inſtruction, that as there is a time, when we are to keepe the devill before us, and to have our eye ſtill upon him, and his weapon or temptation, for feare leſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares he might doe us ſome hurt: ſo is there a place, a time, and a ſinne, that we are to turne our backes on, and not once to looke at his temptation. In affliction, patience is to be tryed; there reſiſt the devill, ſtand to him and he will flye from ye, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. Here we are to ſet the devill before us. But in a caſe of luſt, or filthy deſire, then doe ye flye from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18. So in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.22. we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to flye from the luſts of youth, and to follow juſtice: there is no ſtanding to gaze backe on the devill, and his temptations.</p>

                           </p>
                           <p>The diſputing or deciding of the Devils Title: that is, whether the Kingdomes of the earth were his to give or no, Chriſt ſtands not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nor upon this, whether the devill were a man of his word or no. Indeed, it might well have beene doubted, whether the devill be as good as his word: his promiſes are not <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> as the promiſes of God are. We may take example by <hi>Eve,</hi> to whom he promiſed, that if they did eate of the forbidden fruite, that they ſhould be like Gods; but were they ſo indeed, after they had eaten? No, but like the beaſts that periſh. And as true it is, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are his. If the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had beene at his diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we may be ſure <hi>David</hi> ſhould never have beene King; as well appeareth by the troubles he raiſed againſt him. No, nor <hi>Hezechias</hi> neither, of all other he would never chooſe ſuch. We may ſee his good will in <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 2.7. he could not onely be content to ſpoile him of all that he had, but alſo he muſt afflict his body, and ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Gergaſens</hi> hogges, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.30.</p>
                           <p>The Kingdomes are none of his, but they are committed to him in ſome ſort to diſpoſe, as himſelfe ſaith, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.6. He hath (as it were) an Advowſon of them, to preſent unto them: but yet, not as he there ſaith, to give to whom he liſt, but to whom he is permitted. God muſt firſt put all that <hi>Job</hi> hath in his hands, or elſe he can doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. <hi>Abimelech, Judg.</hi> 9. and <hi>Herod, Matth.</hi> 2. came to their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes by the devils Patent, they be the devils Officers. So we ſee daily in our dayes, that he beſtowes Offices, and preſents to Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. So that as <hi>Brentius</hi> ſaith, Many have <hi>Panem quotidianum,</hi> that cannot come by <hi>Da nobis:</hi> they come not to it by Gods gift: yet all the intereſt that the devill hath, is but to preſent <hi>Pro hac vita tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.</hi> As therefore it may be true, that in ſome ſort they may be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him: ſo yet, not to diſpoſe as he will. It is God onely that can ſay ſo, for his onely they are abſolutely. <hi>The earth is the Lords, and all the fulneſſe thereof, the round world and all that dwell therein, Pſal.</hi> 24.1. It is he (the moſt high God) that divided to the Nations their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.8. <hi>By him Kings raigne, and Princes have dominion, Prov.</hi> 8.15. He brought <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> to know, <hi>That the moſt high God bare rule over the Kingdomes of men, Dan.</hi> 5.21. He indeed may well ſay, <hi>Cui voluero, do ea:</hi> and to whomſoever God giveth, <hi>he giveth liberally, and reproacheth no man, Jam.</hi> 1.5. The devill (we ſee) exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more than the thing is worth, and ſtraineth the benefit of his grant with unjuſt convenants. But Chriſt goes not about to anſwer the devill that way: but by flying to the Scriptures, as to his ſureſt hold. Therefore <hi>David</hi> prayes, that his minde may be inclined to Gods Law, and not to Covetouſneſſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.36. For there is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for every diſeaſe, and power as well againſt this Temptation of Covetouſneſſe, as againſt the former: the Law of God can as well keepe a man from Covetouſneſſe, as from Deſperation: <hi>Heaven and earth ſhall paſſe, but no one jot of this,</hi> Let therefore <hi>Haec omnia</hi> give place to <hi>Scriptum eſt:</hi> marry <hi>Omnia illa,</hi> which both we now enjoy,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48000:390"/>and which are laid up for us hereafter, are come to by <hi>Scriptum eſt.</hi> So that <hi>Omnia haec</hi> is not all we muſt care for; there be things to come (beſides theſe things which we lay hands on) farre more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Though here be all the Kingdomes of the earth: yet they are ſaid to be ſhewed in the twinckling of an eye, ſo cannot the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Kingdome of exceeding glory. All the power of all the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the earth, have not power over one ſilly ſoule to deſtroy it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. All the glory of them, is called but a great big fanne, or pompe, <hi>Act.</hi> 25.23. <hi>Solomon</hi> was the moſt glorious Prince that ever was, yet he was not cloathed like a Lilly, <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.29. Nor all the Lillies in the field, nor Starres in heaven, nor the Sunne and Moone it ſelfe, are comparable to one ſoule.</p>
                           <p>The Scripture whereby Chriſt anſwereth the devill, is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt feare the Lord thy God, and ſerve him.</hi> If any fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſpirit oppoſe it ſelfe againſt <hi>Moſes,</hi> let it be accurſed. There is in this anſwer two things ſet downe; <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Service;</hi> both which are due to God onely. Covetouſneſſe endeth in Idolatry, and fitly is ſo termed: if Chriſt had beene covetouſly minded, then he muſt needs have fallen downe and worſhipped the devill; for Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſſe and Idolatry being joyned together, we would not have parted from ſo great a benefit. Chriſt hath here changed a word, which the <hi>Septuaginta</hi> Tranſlator hath; which ſignifyeth a ſervice with an open teſtimony. So that, will ye know if a man doe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve? <hi>He beleeveth unto righteouſneſſe with the heart, that with the mouth confeſſeth to ſalvation, Rom.</hi> 10.10. Such as glorifie God as well in their members, as in their ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. As Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith of Faith, <hi>Shew me thy faith by thy workes:</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of feare. You ſay you have feare, can you ſhew me your feare? If it be not a dead feare, it is to be ſeene: as <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.5. it muſt be ſhewed by fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe, and worſhipping. The ſervant that feared, fell downe and beſought his maſter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.26. Doe you feare? then where is the outward reverence? The inward affection muſt appeare by the outward action: Religion is outward, as well as inward, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.18.</p>
                           <p>There be two wayes whereby we may have traffique with the devill, either of both will ſerve his turne: firſt, homage: ſecondly, ſervice of the body; and both theſe doth God require, even when we are in the darke, or in our chamber, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 8.12. Indeed might the devill ſay, this Mountaine is very open; but how ſay ye? will ye be content cloſely in a corner to worſhip me? If ye will not weare my cogniſance on your forehead, yet ye may take my marke in your hand; then ſhutting your hand, no body can perceive it. If ye will not take the marke, yet take the number of the Beaſts name; that is, <hi>ſix hundred threeſcore and ſix, Apoc.</hi> 13.17, 18. Will ye doe none of theſe? What then? will ye ſerve me? <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.18. Thus ye ſee what glorious termes he uſeth: but if one ſhould ſeeme to doe one of theſe on courteſie, he will not be content till he doe it of duty.</p>
                           <p>Now let us ſee firſt what it is to <hi>Worſhip.</hi> It is that which <hi>Cornelius</hi>
                              <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48000:390"/>did to <hi>Peter,</hi> he met him, fell downe at his feet, and worſhipped him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.25. And that which <hi>John</hi> did to the Angell; that is, he fell downe before his feet to worſhip him, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19.10. It is, when one on the knees doth a bodily worſhip. I will ſhew it you in <hi>Davids</hi> words: for I cannot tell it ye better. When <hi>Michol</hi> ſcoffed at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> for being bare-headed before the Arke, he ſaith; <hi>I will be more vile than thus, and will be low in mine owne ſight,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.22. A man can never be too reverent to God: we thinke it a great diſgrace, and debaſing of our ſelves, if we uſe any bodily worſhip to God. It may be ſaid to them, as it was to him, that feared to doe too much reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <hi>Caeſar, Hic homo timet timere Caeſarem.</hi> Our religion and <hi>Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> muſt be uncovered, and a bare-faced religion: we would not uſe to come before a meane Prince, as we doe before the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, even the God of heaven and earth. The foure and twenty Elders fell downe before him that ſate on the Throne, and worſhipped him that liveth for ever, and caſt their crownes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Throne. The wandring eye muſt learne to be faſtened on him, <hi>Luke.</hi> 4.20. and the worke of Juſtice and Peace, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 32.17. The worſhip of the <hi>knees to bow, Epheſ.</hi> 3.14. and <hi>kneele before the Lord their Maker, Pſal.</hi> 95.6. Our feet are to come before his face: <hi>For the Lord is a great God; and a great King above all Gods, Pſa.</hi> 95.2, 3. <hi>Jacob,</hi> though he were not able to ſtand, or kneele: yet (becauſe he would uſe ſome corporall ſervice) leaned upon his ſtaffe, and worſhipped God, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.33. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.21. This muſt be done as duty due unto God, and in regard of thoſe that be ſtrangers.</p>
                           <p>Secondly, what it is to <hi>Serve.</hi> This is to bow the ſoule, as the other is to bow the body. For the King to ſerve and ſpeake kindly to the people, that they may ſerve him for ever after, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 12.7. is not the ſervice he meaneth, nor to do all that the King commands, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.15. For God muſt be above all: and of whomſoever a man is overcome, to him he is in bondage, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.19. We muſt ſerve God with our ſacrifices, but not with our ſinnes, nor weary him with our iniquities, <hi>Eſay</hi> 43.23. We may not make a dung cart of him, to load him with our ſinne and filth, <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. and when he comes againe to have as much more for him.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>[Onely.]</hi> The devill himſelfe would grant, that God is to be ſerved; his meaning was, that a man might ſerve God, and him too: but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>God onely.</hi> But it may be ſaid, this word <hi>[Onely]</hi> is not in the Scripture whence Chriſt citeth this ſentence, and ſo Chriſt hath added to the word of God. Indeed, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Alone</hi> is not, but in the next <hi>ver.</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>Doe not follow after other Gods,</hi> which is in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>God onely.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>The Papiſts aske, where we find <hi>Onely</hi> in juſtification by faith? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we doe not finde it, but we doe find, that by faith and nothing elſe we are juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. and ſo we may well collect it, by faith onely. <hi>By grace we are ſaved through faith: and that not of our ſelves; it is the gift of God, Epheſ.</hi> 2.7. And on this warrant have many of the Ancient Fathers beene bold, to adde the word <hi>Onely:</hi> as <hi>Origen</hi>
                              <pb n="58" facs="tcp:48000:391"/>upon <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. <hi>Hilary</hi> upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 8. and divers others ſay, <hi>Faith onely juſtifyeth.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>God is onely to be worſhipped and ſerved, and none beſides him. <hi>Zephaniah</hi> prophecyeth againſt them that ſerve the hoſte of heaven upon the houſe top, and ſweare by <hi>Malcham, Zepha.</hi> 1.5. But <hi>Jacob</hi> ſware by the feare of his Father <hi>Iſaac:</hi> and it is ſaid, <hi>They feared the Lord, &amp; ſerved their Idols alſo, Gen.</hi> 32.53. 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 17.41. It is the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Aarons</hi> rod, that being turned into a Serpent, if the Magicians turne theirs alſo into Serpents, <hi>Aarons</hi> will devoure the reſt, <hi>Exo.</hi> 7.15. Bring the Arke into the Temple of <hi>Dagon, Dagon</hi> will fall downe and break his face, and though it were lifted up againe, yet it fell down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 5.3. The ſtories beare witneſſe, that the gods of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews</hi> would not come into <hi>Pantho. Samuel</hi> bade the people, <hi>If they were come againe to the Lord with all their hearts, to put away their ſtrange gods from amongſt them,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.4. If there were any other (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide him) that were able to helpe up, we might have ſome reaſon to ſerve other: but ſince it is he that muſt helpe us in all neceſſities, we muſt worſhip him alone: otherwiſe, when we pray to him, he may ſend us to <hi>the gods which we have choſen to ſerve, for our helpe, Judg.</hi> 10.14. If we could finde an equall, or a better than God, we had ſome reaſon to make him a partner in his worſhip: but if none be worthy once to be named with him, (ſo farre is all beneath him) we ſhall offer him too much diſgrace and injury in ſo doing. It is an embaſing of gold to have any other metall joyned with it: yea, though it be ſilver: <hi>The Sonne</hi> (ſaith <hi>Malachi,</hi> Chap. 1.6.) <hi>honoureth his Father, and the ſervant his Lord: if I be your Father, where is your honour which you doe me? if your Lord, where is your reverence?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we account of God, as of our Lord and Maſter; or whether we take him for a Father, a man can have but one father, except he be a baſtard, <hi>Eſay</hi> 2.14. and ſo be <hi>Filius populi:</hi> if for a husband, not two husbands, for he is a jealous God, and cannot abide that. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters, but he muſt love the one, and deſpiſe the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; no man can love God and Mammon.</hi>

                                 <hi>BLeſſed is the man</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 1.12.) <hi>that endureth temptation: for when he is tryed, he ſhall receive the Crowne of life.</hi> Chriſt hath endured the temptation, now followes the bleſſing. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> would not let the Angell depart (with whom he ſtrove,) before he had bleſſed him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Job</hi> (after his afflictions) received his twofold bleſſing, <hi>Job</hi> 42. the woman of <hi>Canaan</hi> firſt heareth her ſelfe accounted a dogge: but at laſt ſhe heard, <hi>Fiat tibi. Paul</hi> was firſt buffeted by the pricke of the fleſh: and after heard, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> So here at laſt, when the devill ſaw it was bootleſſe to ſtay any longer, there was no good by him to be done, he leaves our Saviour: but yet he went not away willingly of himſelfe, but was ſent away with an <hi>Avant.</hi> Which is a comfort to us to think we
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48000:391"/>ſtand not at the devils courteſie, and that he ſhall not attempt us ſo long as the liſt, for God hath the devill in a chaine, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 20.2. and <hi>will not ſuffer him to tempt us above our ſtrength,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13. <hi>For the rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt on the lot of the righteous, leſt the righteous put forth their hand to wickedneſſe, Pſal.</hi> 125.3. To have the devill not to come to us is a great favour, but to have him come, and goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way conquered, is exceeding mercy. <hi>For tribulation brings patience, and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope makes not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, Rom.</hi> 5.4.

                              </p>
                              <p>And as <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith, Chap. 15.10. <hi>There is joy with the Angels in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, upon the converſion of every ſinner.

Before God, are ſaid to ſtand, <hi>ten thouſand Angels, Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>and to miniſter before him.</hi> He hath a greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, <hi>but we are alſo herein partakers of the divine nature,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. either becauſe we are fed by Angels, as <hi>Elias</hi> was, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 19.5. or defended by them, or watched of them. But ſaith <hi>Eſay</hi> Chap. 18.18. <hi>He that beleeveth makes not haſte.</hi> Chriſt was not haſty, but ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods good time: he would not make his owne bread, but ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the <hi>Angels miniſtred unto him. Then there appeared an Angell to comfort him, Luk.</hi> 22.43. This wiſdome muſt we learne by holding our tongue; <hi>Job</hi> 33.33. otherwiſe one of theſe two extremes ſhall we come to: either <hi>Extremum luctus gaudium occupat:</hi> or <hi>Extrema gaudii luctus occupat,</hi> ſaith <hi>Bernard, Luk.</hi> 16.25.</p>
                              <p>The world is like <hi>Jael,</hi> who meetes <hi>Siſera, Judg.</hi> 4.19. and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines him at firſt very friendly, ſhee allures him to her, and gives him drinke, and layes him downe: but ſo ſoone as he was aſleepe, ſhe ſmites a naile into his temples: The world beginnes with milke, and ends with a hammer.
